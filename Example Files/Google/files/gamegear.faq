Section I: Unanswered Questions
[ This section will contain various questions which have not been answered. ]
[ If you can provide an answer to any of these questions please send e-mail ]
[ to the author.                                                            ]

Q:  In Indiana Jones, are there any items (like a shield) in the wall/whip
    scene?  Is it possible to get through the Zepplin with just one I.J.
life?
    After getting time at the top and getting the sheild is there another
time
    piece or a short cut to the plane?

Q:  In Defender of Oasis, in the castle where you rescue the Princess, how
can
    you get through the door that leads to the double force fields?  Also, in
    the temple of spirits (can't recall the corerct name - the one you get
    inside using the hammer), I'm unable to get to several of the chests on
the
    elevated icy floor.  There's a staircase in the middle of all the chests
    that's clearly connected to another below this level, but this lower
    stairway is enclosed in a walled area and inaccessable from the outside.
    There is another staircase that leads up into the walled area, but I
can't
    find any stairs below this that lead into the walled section.  I explored
    the temple to the point where I can get through random encounters without
    much damage, but I still haven't found a way through this.

Q:  What are the level passwords to "Predator II" for Game Gear?  I keep
getting
    killed just before the end of the first level and I'm inclined to cheat.

Sonic Chaos

Q: Do you have any info on Sonic Chaos?

Special Stage One:  Break the Sonic monitor and fly right.  At first, stay on
		    the line where the small rings appear, because you can
clear
		    two lines of the large rings with one pass, and these are
		    usually the lines with the highest ring density (there's
		    more rings on these lines).

Special Stage Two:  Go to the right, jump on the rightmost plartform.  Board
the
		    spring, and look for the side which has the highest
platform
		    to the side of it.  If you move to the extreme right and
		    left with your spring, you will see platforms above you
to
		    the right and/or left.  When Sonic is at the highest
point
		    of the spring jump, jump up and to the side you're on and
		    you'll end up on the next platform.  Keep repeating this,
		    until you're on the platform with the emerald.  If you
need
		    time, there is at least one clock monitor which halts the
		    time left clock for a few seconds near the top of this
		    stage.

Special Stage 3:  Go into the tube to your right by breaking the
invincibility
		  monitor.  If you press up for the rest of the stage, you'll
go
		  into the room with the emerald.  Explanation:  you go
through
		  the same thing several times, with the crisscross tubes,
and
		  then after several of these, you'll notice the pattern
		  changes.  If you look to your right before the tube goes
		  upward, you'll see the emerald for a split second.  The
tube
		  then curves to the left, and you'll come up on an
intersection
		  where you can continue to the left or go up.  You want to
go
		  up.

Special Stage 4:  This one doesn't leave much time to spare.  The emerald is
on
		  a high platform which you can't jump onto at the rightmost
		  point on the stage.  One way to do it is to run and jump as
		  fast as you can to the right.  Jump as far as you can,
		  avoiding the recesses , ending up on a point about as high
as
		  you are.  Try running or using the combination down+1 to
get
		  some speed, and then jump at the end of the platform.  At
one
		  point you'll reach a downward sloping towards the right
		  platform, followed by a high sheer platform.  You have two
		  options.  Either you can do a down+1 then jump to get on
the
		  platform, and use the rocket shoes monitor there to fly
right,
		  or you can break through this hill.  When you can't break
any
		  more walls, jump and you'll break the one below you, then
		  break the walls to your right again, repeat.  At this point
		  you can run right and pick up a clock monitor to stop time.
		  You'll want to either continue right and then back up and
pick
		  up some rocket shoes, or backtrack and pick up an earlier
		  pair.  From here, rocket shoes are pretty much required to
		  save time.  You will go from shoes to running & jumping for
		  short periods of time several times.  Usually you have to
back
		  up and get a pair.  If you end up running on a row of tiles
at
		  the bottom of the screen whichcrumble from under your feet,
		  you've gone too far, and need to back up for the final set
of
		  shoes.  These are the only way I know of to reach the
platform
		  with the emerald on it.  This is one big-@ss level, sorry I
		  can't give a more detailed explanation.  Some tips:  if
your
		  reach an area where there's a diagonal line of the
stationary
		  plunger thingys to you're right, you want to scale this
hill,
		  by jumping just to the left the plunger on the level you
want
		  to land on.  If you reach an area where there's one plunger
on
		  the lower left, one on the lower right, and one on the
upper
		  right, I THINK you want to backtrack.

Special Stage 5:  Last one, and it's a nastier version of the third.  You can
		  pick up a bunch of time monitors on this level by diverting
		  from the default path (straight) at intersections.  This
one
		  isn't as bad as Stage 4.  Sorry, no direct set of moves
here.
		  Suggestion:  pause the game every so often to look at the
area
		  around you when you're in the tubes.  Take the side paths.
		  The 5th emerald is in a room which is hard to locate,
because
		  it's so small.  The room is on the left side of the level,
and
		  is approachable from the inside of the level.  Look for an
		  intersection where one of you're options is a tube that
leads
		  into a room with a plunger which is ready to shoot you back
		  where you came from.  If you look, you'll see that there's
a
		  clear path just above the plunger thing.  Jump and use the
D
		  button to avoid being thrown back out, and take the path
above
		  it.  The emerald is down this path.

Robotnik &
Level 3 Electric Egg Zone:  On level 3, run to your right down the slope, and
			    jump to the other side.  Then jump back onto the
			    platform to your left, and use it to launch
yourself
			    intothe tube above.  Press down when you do this,
so
			    you can go into a side tube and get the 10 ring
			    monitor.  Immediately press right to continue
			    towards robotnik.  Ride the elevator platform you
			    land on, and go to the right.  Best way to kill
			    robotnik #1:  stay on the right side of the
screen
			    and attack robotnik to the left, flying back to
the
			    right after bouncing off him.  This way when you
get
			    shot, you can get the ring back without robotnik
			    standing on it.  For robo #2, stay low.  When the
			    ship appears, and then goes off one side of the
			    screen, sonic shoot yourself to the opposite side
of
			    the screen so he doesn't kill you when he
reappears.
			    After a few times of this, you can see his
pattern
			    and then jump on top of him once to kill him.

Q:  In Sonic Chaos when you continue a game, do you still have all of the
    emeralds you picked up?  I won by continues, and there wasn't a real
ending
    sequence, I just chased robotnik for a few seconds, and that was it.  If
you
    let him go for awhile, do you get something other than the ending
sequence?

When you continue, you still keep all the emeralds you had before.  The only
difference with sonic real ending and the one without the credits is that
without the chaos emeralds Sonic falls on his face.  The real ending shows:
Sonic chasing Robotnik for the rings.  Robotnik drops the rings.  Sonic gets
the
rings and next thing you see sonic is inside the Chaos Emerald running a 360
and
then the credits roll.  Nothing really spectacular of course.

Sonic I

Q: How do I get the 50,000 special bonus at the end of the game?

You may get 50,000 special bonus at the end of the game for each of
the following:

- Collecting all chaos emeralds
- Reaching all 8 special zones
- Completing every special zone in time
- Finding all sonic monitors
  (did you know, that there is a sonic monitor in every zone/act - except
   specials?)

Q:  In Sonic 1, where are the 3rd, 4th and 5th gems?  Any clues on how to get
to
    the sixth gem?  (On the blimp.)

3rd gem:  In Act 1 go to the second waterfall.  Go to the platform underneath
          you.  The third gem is reached by jumping on a log to the left.

4th gem:  It's to the left when you are almost done with Act 2.

5th gem:  This one is reached by taking one of the tubes in the scrap brain.

6th gem:  This one I actually remember quite well, as I had to go to Usenet
to
	  get the answer!  At the start of Act 2, jump a little bit towards
	  the left.  You'll land on a platform and be on your way to the
	  emerald.

Q:  In Sonic 1, where are all the monitors?

Zone/Act          Location

1/1    After the first pit, hidden in a palm tree (jump under it to
       knock it down)
1/2    Enter cave, go left to the bottom (Sonic stands 'knee-deep in
       water), jump left to enter a secret passage
1/3    Jump into the second pit, go right
2/1    Using the second balance jump onto the high cliff
2/2    Floating in water - you can't miss it ;-)
2/3    Just go left at start - suppress your urge to go right
       immediately ;-)
3/1    On top of the first waterfall (if you fall down to the log - you
       still can reach it by going to the second waterfall and back from
there)
3/2    Approx. halfway through the level find a platform with 8 rings on the
       left of the waterfall. Jump right over the long spiked log, Jump right
       off the log.
3/3    Go right, jump into the water, it is at the bottom.
4/1    At the end of the level (when you are out of the water again,
       going up) switch on the left switches the monitor between 'rings' and
       'Sonic'.
4/2    Fall down to to a place where air bubbles appear on a short
       platform jump into the left pit, go left to the end of the corridor,
       break the monitor by 'roll attack' (down) - don't try to jump!
4/3    Jump off the spring, enter corridor left, jump over spikes
       (careful!), it is at the end.
5/1    It is on the first transporter belt you encounter (be quick -
otherwise
       it will fall down)
5/2    At the place where the corridor branches into 'upper' and 'lower'
branch
       - take the 'lower' one, pass the door, go down, jump right into the
deep
       pit, go left, use transporter.
5/3    When you are at the bottom of the level you see it behind closed door.
       To get there go up, left, up, left, up, right, up, right, dooooown.
6/1    On the second flying platform: jump off it before it reaches
destination,
       go a few platforms down
6/2    At start go left, land on a flying platform, change to the second
       platform, then jump onto a ladder, go up the ladder.
6/3    If you found all 17 monitors described above - the 18-th one will be
       there just at your feet.

If you find and break all the 18 monitors you receive 50,000 extra bonus at
the
end of the game (plus bonus for lives left).  Apart from the above, there are
Sonic monitors in special zones #2, 4, 6 and 8.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sonic II

Q:  How do you fly using the glider in Sonic 2 Game Gear?

Take the glider without jumping off the hill/cliff whatsoever.  Go back
(left),
keeping the glider, then run to the right.  This way, you'll get enough speed
for a stable flight after getting off the ground.  While flying, press [left]
to
gain height, and [right] to increase speed.  Do not use left/right too often
between your flight, because you'll lose speed by getting height and vice
versa.
The manual left out one little thing.  They say push left to go up and right
to
go down, but they forgot to say 'Push the D-button up to keep your self
afloat
and slowly sail across the sky.'

Q:  Has anyone found those two little yellow chicks in Scene 1 of Zone II?
 What
    purpose do they serve?

Yes!  From the start - Run across the collapsing bridge the jump across the
platforms to the first plunger platform (it has a ring monitor).  There is an
extra Sonic on a platform to the right of this which is optional.  Take the
plunger up to the next platform (with the bricked up tunnels).  Through the
tunnels knocking out the bricks (and the turtle).  Now start climbing the
"platforms in the sky" NOT the building ones.  Get to the highest point which
will almost take you off the screen and bounce LEFT.  You'll arrive on a
platform with two trees and an extra Sonic monitor.  DO NOT break the
monitor.
Jump over it to the left, turn round and PUSH the monitor.  The two chicks
will
appear.  If you keep pushing more chicks will appear.

No idea what they do though.

Q:  What is the Level Select sequence for Game Gear Sonic II?

1. Press the start button to get rid of the running scene
2. During the next screen, press and hold start, button 1, button 2, and
press
   south-west on the directional button.  Hold everything until you hear
chimes.
3. Let go and press start to get the the level-select screen.

or try this...

1. Before the Portrait Screen comes up, hold south-west and buttons 1 and 2.
2. Tails will blink 3 times.  When his eye is closed from the third blink,
hit
start (with everything else still held) and the level select screen will come
up.

Q:  How do I get unlimited lives in Sonic II?

This is a common feature of Sonic 2.  There are two free Sonics monitors on
Act
1!  The big acts for free Sonics have to be Act 1 of level 4 and Act 1 of
level
5.  The original Sonic game let you obtain these monitors only once.  Once
you
were killed, the monitors were gone forever.

In Act 2 of the first level of Sonic 2 on the Game Gear you can generate
unlimited lives since there is a bug/feature which means that the extra life
icon is available even if you have been killed on that act before.  In act 2
of
level 1 it is easy to get 100 rings so you get the extra life and collect 100
lives and kill yourself, and start over.  Thus you gain two and lose one for
each attempt.

In Level 6 the second round of this is another ideal place to restock on
Sonics!
There will be a plunger on a hill after you've passed the "Martians" and the
right- left-up maze.  Press down on the D-button to go into the super fast
mode.
There will be a free Sonic at the top.  Go to the right.  There are rings
galore.  I think there are a hundred rings here!  Go back to the left.  There
is
another free Sonic.  Go down and to the right.  There's a free Sonic here
too.


Q:  Where are the chaos Emeralds in Sonic II?

All of the emeralds will be found in the second act of
the first 5 zones.

Zone I emerald: To get to the end of this round, you have to take a plunger
to
		the right.  Instead of doing that, take the plunger to the
left.
		Go to the top of the hill, get the ring monitor, and push
"down"
		on the D-button to make Sonic go really fast.  Take the rail
		cart.  Stay in the rail cart for a little bit past the end of
		the track.  Jump off towards the upper right.  The emerald is
		there.


Zone II emerald: This is one that I needed help to get.  Towards the middle
of
		 the round, there will be a row in the clouds with rings.
 There
		 will be one plunger next to it at a higher level, and
another
		 plunger a little bit past this one.  Take the latter plunger
at
		 an angle towards the right.  You'll be on an invisible
platform
		 in the clouds.  Jump off the clouds past the last cloud.
 There
		 will be an invisible plunger.  Take this plunger towards the
		 right (again, it helps if you are at an angle to the very
		 right) and the emerald will be at the highest point.

Zone III emerald:  There will be a maze towards the middle of the round (not
the
		   first maze!).  Press the D-button left.

Zone IV emerald:  When you get towards the end, you'll see some plungers with
		  rings that you won't quite be able to reach.  Go back to
the
		  plungers on the left.  Use them to get to the right.

Zone V emerald:  The last one!  (I'm not counting the emerald that you get
for
		 defeating the Silver Sonic.)  This one was tricky.  Towards
the
		 beginning of the round, you'll see a diagonal area that has
		 spikes coming down.  There is a hidden room here.  To access
		 it, jump to the left while you are almost at the top.  At
the
		 very left, there are flywheels (with two more secret
hideouts
		 to the left containing free Sonics!).  Take the flywheels
up.
		 The emerald is towards your right.


Q:  How do I kill the Bosses in Sonic II?

Zone I boss: Stay away from the balls.  I thought at first the object was
also
	     to hit the lobster (or plant, or whatever) but all you have to
do
	     is stay away from that and the balls.  Some of the balls require
	     you to jump over them, while others need for you to go
underneath
	     them when they bounce.

Or try this: Another tactic is to jump over all the rocks, whether they be
high
	     bouncin' or low bouncin'.  Stand near the ant-lion, and wait for
	     the rock to get very close to me, then jump *towards* the
antlion.
	     In the air, *arch back* towards the center of the screen.  (So
you
	     end up jumping a loop, starting and ending just in front of the
	     ant-lion.)  It takes a little practice to know when to jump for
	     different rocks, but it does work.

Zone II boss:  It helps to hit two of the small birds at once.  You'll kill 4
	       birds on the top level, then 4 more birds will come down.
 After
	       that, you'll drop to the next level.  Kill the eggs so that
they
	       don't have any more birds coming out of them, so you can
	       concentrate on the Mother Goose (as I like to call it).

Zone III boss:  To kill this one, jump on him when he has a ball on his head.
		This is probably the easiest boss.

Zone IV boss:  One of the worst!  The boss himself is not ridiculously hard,
but
	       to get there is rather difficult, as it's all plungers and
	       spikes!  This boss is a hog that transforms himself into a
golden
	       sphere that moves across the screen.  It's only safe to jump
on
	       him while he's a hog.  Sometimes he'll go to one side, remain
a
	       sphere, and then go back, but usually, he transforms back into
a
	       hog as soon as he reaches the opposite side.

Zone V boss: It's only safe to jump on him when he does not have his spikes
	     standing up.  He will lose his spikes when he hits the wall.
 There
	     will also be small white balls that fall from the sky.  I found
	     this round to be slightly easier if I didn't even try to jump on
	     him the first time, and just stayed away from the balls.  After
	     that, I could position myself better.  Also, it seems to help if
	     the jumping is done quickly and flawlessly.  I managed to do
this
	     once or twice, and it substantially cut down on the number of
balls
	     that fell from the sky.

Zone VI boss:  The Silver Sonic!  It's not really that difficult.  The way to
	       kill this one is by jumping on him when he's a regular Sonic,
and
	       not a ball.  (Jumping on the ball doesn't hurt either, as long
as
	       you're on top.)

Zone VII boss:  This was hard.  Basically, the pattern is as follows:  Jump
on
		Robotnik as soon as you leave the tube.  Go back into the
tube
		and go around and around.  Get out of the tube after you see
the
		lightning flash the second time.  Jump on Robotnik.  Go back
in
		the tube.  Go around and around, etc.

Defenders of Oasis

Q:  How do I get the other chests and reach the stairs on the ice patch level
of
Defender of the Oasis.

Right next to the stair entrance (on its left), there is a chest.  Now, on
the
strip of land (way at the bottom), walk to the column that if you skate up,
you'll reach that chest.  Now skate :  U (you'll stop at the chest right next
to
the stairs) (open it and grab the goodies).  R D L U L :  there you are at
the
entrance of the stairs.

With these movements, you'll grab the chests that cannot be reached by
skating directly.

Q:  Is there a secret screen in DoD?

Yes, there is a secret screen in DoO.  All you have to do is hold up & start
at
the title screen.  What you will see is a sound test of all the music, sound
effects and voices.  To exit the sound test screen hit start, to listen to
the
music press either 1 or 2.  There are only 3 voices, and about 40 sound
effects.

Castle of Illusion with Mickey Mouse

Q:  In Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion Game Gear Version, how do you kill the
    Chocolate looking dude in the Candy world?

Each time he hits the wall four chocolate pieces fall, three disappear, one
stays.  Pick up the remaining one, jump and throw it at the guy when in
mid-air
(works ony when he is 'fully assembled', with face).  Repeat four times.
 With
some practice you can do it quickly.  Throw it when he is hitting the wall,
then
the next piece will fall down and he will not disassemble, so you can throw
again.  You can finish him in <15 seconds this way.


Secret Treasures:  To grab two secret treasure chests go to the very far
right
		   of the forest in Level 1.  You'll discover two treasure
		   chests in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.  Jump
on
		   the chest on the right and then jump up to the right side
of
		   the screen in one motion.  Two treasure chests appear just
		   above and to the right of the first two chests.  Quickly
jump
		   onto them.  They will break open and two coins will
appear,
		   each worth 2,000 points.

		   Another secret treasure in the same Level is towards the
		   end:  when you passed the cave and go down (to re-emerge
in
		   the forest) go left and attack jump - another 2 treasure
		   chests with big coins appear.



Secret Life:  In level 4 enter the coffee cup screen.  Exit the coffee cup
and
	      jump across the three rotating platforms until you reach the
first
	      dancing Letter A.  Climb the ladder to the left of the screen
	      until you reach a room with two bugs, a button, and a barrel.
	      Kill the bugs by throwing the barrel and the button.  The
button
	      disappears but you can use the barrel to climb up the ladder on
	      the right side of the screen.  You'll enter a screen where
there's
	      another bug to the right.  Kill the bug by jumping on it and
	      continue to the right until you reach a second dancing Letter
A.
	      Pass the Letter A and keep going right.  You'll come upon a
tiny
	      drop in the floor that looks like it was made out of wood.  The
	      drop is just big enough for Mickey to fit into.  Jump up by
	      pressing Button 2 twice so that Mickey comes down on his
behind.
	      This pops the floor and allows Mickey to enter a secret room
with
	      two treasure chests containing a coin and a free Mickey.  There
is
	      one more secret life on the same level.  When you finished the
	      level and go to the boss room - you have to go down a ladder.
	      Jump down the ladder (pressing 2) press left and keep it
pressed.
	      At some point Mickey will stop falling down and enter a secret
	      passage, leading to a room with additional life chest.

General tips:
The most important thing to remember about Lemmings is:DONT PANIC! If
you feel
that everything is moving too quickly, you can slow down the rate of
lemmings,
and that should give you a bit more time to think.

The first couple of times you play a level you're not sure of, turn the
second
lemming into a blocker - to hold back the rest of them - and just
concentrate
on the first one. This way you don't have to worry about 20 lemmings at
once.

Very often any problem on a level is more obvious that it looks. Look
at the
amounts of the various characters that you've been allocated, and work
it out
from there.

Remember: you can select the characters (builder, digger etc.) while
the game's
in pause mode. This will help the more nervous players out there.

Shinobi 1

Q:  In Shinobi 1, how do you get past the level in the final city that slowly
    fills up with water as you hop from platform to platform?  (The platforms
    eventually lead underwater where you must drown...)

This one is nasty.  You must use the Pink Ninja (Yellow cannot walk on this
water).  When you use a Ninjutsu, the water level goes down and starts
filling
again.  Using the Pink Ninja jump up to the first platform and bomb the
robot.
Then jump up and get the Ninjutsu.  Then jump over to the second block to the
right and before touching it or the water, while in midair use your Ninjutsu.
The water will then lower for awhile.  Walk through that robot, jump up to
the
next one and bomb him.  Get the Ninjutsu.  You should still have just enough
time to just jump towards the second block to the right and use your Ninjutsu
in
midair.  Now before the water raises again, you'll have to jump and run/jump
as
fast as you can to the right and then just as the water touches your ankles
you
can enter the door.

Q: How do you get that Secret Bonus in Shinobi I for Game Gear?

Finish a round without grabbing any of the Ninjitsus and then you'll get the
Secret Bonus of 3000 points.

Shinobi 2: The Silent Fury

Passwords: D09F9 - Yellow, Pink, Green, and Blue Ninja.

           DDE91 - All Ninjas and the Yellow, Pink, and Blue Crystals.
           1FEDF - All items (Ready for last level).

Q:  How do you get the secret bonus?

Just finish a round without opening up any boxes that contain bombs and
you'll
get a 3000-point bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

Q: How do you get the Cross in the first scene?

Start at the room where you see the cross.  Move left and jump, walk across
the
bridge.  Get the whip and kill guard Climb up the rope and jump to the ledge
at
the right.  Jump to the second rope and climb up until you see another
climber.
Go down the rope and jump to the room to the right of the rope.  Wait until
the
climber starts to climb up and then jump back to the rope.  Climb up and jump
to
the first ledge at the left.  Wait until the climber go down jump right to
the
rope and jump right again.  Walk right until you reach to the ledge jump
right,
jump right again.  By now you have extra time from the hourglass you picked
up.
Climb down the rope, move left until you reach to ledge and drop down.

Now you've collected the cross finish the scene.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminator

Q: In Terminator, how do you get past the first level?

>From the start run across the surface to the ladder.  Ignore the attack
"helicopters".  Descend the ladder and run to the left, blasting the wall
with
three grenades.  Run to the end of the walkway and jump down to the stairs
and
run to the right.  Continue jumping and running to the right until you get to
another wall, blast this with three grenades and run through the hole.  At
this
point your energy gets reset to 100%.  Run to the right until you get to a
double wall, blast with grenades.  Run to the right and up the stairs.  The
walkway above and to the left is where the bomb will appear later.  Jump up
to
the right on to the platform formed by the pipework.  Jump to the right on to
the next platform, and then on to the next.  An Uzi should be available to
the
right of the ladder.Collect the Uzi and go back to where the bomb will
appear.
It is possible to jump across the platforms.  Start the bomb then go back to
the
ladder where the Uzi was.  Climb the ladder then run to the left until a down
ladder appears.  Descend this ladder and run up the stairs to the left.  At
the
top of the stairs jump across to the up ladder, and climb up.  Then run
across
to the time-machine and in.  That's all you need to do.  Of course it's
necessary to destroy any terminators as required!  I think it's easier to try
and outrun anything following you than to destroy them.  It seems that speed
is
more important, especially when the bomb has been activated.

Spiderman

Q:  In Spiderman, level 4 how do you get the key at the top of the screen at
    the end of the level? It is protected by a series of electric sparks.

Go to the platform right below the first line of sparks.  If you watch the
sparks, you will notice that there is a pattern.  The sparks will stop for
about
a second at regular intervals.  When you see this opening, jump up, shoot
your
web and hang below the next line of sparks to wait for another opening.
Eventually, you'll make it up to the top and grab the key.  Then, as you fall
down, shoot your web up and hang below the last line of sparks to wait for
the
screen to fade out.  NOTE:  there also is a pseudo-opening in the sparks.  It
will seem to have stopped, but the spark will flash realy quickly, knocking
you
down if you jumped.  After you learn to distinguish the two, it should become
quite easy.

Q:  What is the "Blood" code for Game Gear?

Press 2,1,2,Down,Up. The screen will display "Now Entering Kombat."

Q:  What happens when a fighter does a fatality in Mortal Kombat?  What
happens when the fighter defeats Shang Tung?

Johnny Cage:  Fatality:  punches the head off of the opponent.  What happens
	      when he beats Shang Tsung:  It says that he's learned the true
	      spirit of competition and goes back to Hollywood to film Mortal
	      Kombat the Movie and its many sequels.  Hint on how to defeat
	      Goro:  keep on shadow kicking him (T,B,K) you can get a
flawless
	      if you duck the first second and then start hitting the buttons
	      over and over again rhythmically.

Scorpion:     Fatality:  rips off his mask to reveal a skull and blows a
	      stream of fire at opponent so he/she goes up in smoke.  How to
	      beat Shang Tsung:  Wait til Shang transforms into one of the
	      reg.  characters and beat the crap out of him/ her.  When he
	      beats Shang Tsung because as you know Scorpion had a wife and
	      child in a former life and when he becomes Supreme MK Warrior
it
	      says that he will live forever not knowing about his wife and
	      child in his former life...

Liu Kang:     Fatality:  not too bloody; he just spins and knocks the
opponent
	      out.  What happens when he beats Shang Tsung:  he restores the
	      tournament back to its rightful place (big whoop.)  with the
	      Shaolin monks.

Sonya:        Fatality:  she blows this small little fireball at the opponent
	      that engulfs him in flames.  What happens when she beats Shang:
	      Her friends get released...

Rayden:       Fatality:  he zaps the head off of the opponent with his
	      lightning.  What happens when he defeats Shang:  This by far is
	      the funniest of all endings.  It says that since he is immor-
	      tal, winning the tourny was no big whoop to him and he gets
	      bored playing with mortals so he calls upon other Gods in his
	      own tournament.  It says that the ensuing wars cause the
	      ultimate destruction of the world as we know it.  Then it says,
	      "Have a nice day."  :)

Q:  Are there any Game Genie codes for MK on Game Gear?

Yes, they are:

003-488-F79  Player 1 is invincible
00B-40C-3BE  Infinite Time
240-C5D-C4B  Player 2 usually starts with 1/2 health.

Fun stuff to do with MK:

If you're using Sonya, after your opponent is defeated, do the flying punch.
 If
you time it right, she'll do her victory pose while standing in mid-air,
rather
than on the ground.  Funny-looking.

If you're using Sub-Zero and it says "Finish Him", you can freeze your
opponent
forever.  Just wait for him to thaw out, then freeze again and you can do it
over and over again and the game will never end.

A cheating way to kill Goro is to punch him a couple of times at the
beginning
of the round, then just jump up and down in the same spot until the round is
over, and you'll win on energy level, since Goro will just stand there and do
nothing to you.

Chuck Rock

Q:  In Chuck Rock for Game Gear, how do you kill the wooly mamoth at the end
of
    the 3rd level?

I managed this by taking the boulder then reapeatedly dropping this on the
mammoth's head.

To be successful:-

1) You need to lob the boulder from a point on the rock plateau where it will
   just fall over the edge (ie.  it is close for you to pick it back up)
2) You have to judge the time at which to throw it, as I recall it's
somewhere
   near the middle of the screen as the mammoth returns right to left towards
   you.
3) Hopefully you smack him on the bonce (if not just get the boulder and try
   again).
4) Once the mammoth is returning left to right, jump down and grab the
boulder
   throw it back up on to the plateau.
5) Quickly jump back up onto the plateau (you don't have much time which is
why
   you must make sure you drop the boulder on him close enough for you to
safely
   retrieve it).
6) Grab the boulder again and start from 1).

I can't rememer the exact number of hits you need but I guess it is around 8
-
10.

Q:  How do I get to Lassic?  Does it have anything to do with the Aeroprism
and
the Nuts?  Where do I use them?

When you reach the outside of Baya Malay and see the screen with the blue sky
go
to the ITEM screen and USE PRISM.  The sky changes colour and a different
song
begins to play.  A castle appears in the upper part of the screen.  Again go
to
the ITEM screen and USE LARMA NUTS.  Mayu eats the nuts, goes through a
transformation, and flies you up to the castle.  After you beat the Guard
Dragon
enter the big house at the end of the road and you're on your way to defeat
Lassic.

Tips:  1) Before journeying to defeat Lassic get rid of anything that is not
	  necessary to kill him (old armor, weapons, etc.).  You'll need to
keep
	  a TRANSFER which you use to excape after you beat Lassic, or you
must
	  have some speel points left and the Fly Spell.  Then buy as many
	  Burgers as possible in order to save magic points for curing people
	  when they're really needed.

       2) After the point where you no longer need to buy things (except
	  Burgers) don't open treasure chests that were held by monsters
unless
	  you're sure they hold something important.  Many of the treasure
	  chests are actually traps.  3) When you've found all of the items
	  avoid opening any treasure chests unless you need money
desperately.

"Quest for the Shaven Yak starring Ren Hoek & Stimpy"
Rating: 5/5

This is a standard platform game in which you can play either Ren or Stimpy
or
both on their quest to find the Shaven Yak in order to return his hooves and
thereby save Yak Shaving Day.  If you're a fan of the show then you'll love
all
of the show's elements in the game, otherwise you'll probably be confused
about
why anyone would make a game where one of the protagonists coughs up
hairballs
at his enemies, and after you unpause the game the other is caught picking
his
rear-end.  There's lots of Ren & Stimpy style humor in the game like this.
 The
graphics in this game are excellent, and even the enemies' graphics represent
the style of the cartoon.  There are also cartoon scenes at the start,
between
each level (which you'll miss if you use the passwords in this FAQ), when you
lose all your lives, and a longer one when you win the game.  It also
includes
music from the show, such as the Muddy Mudskipper theme song, and the
"Happy-Happy-Joy-Joy" music.  You can play either as Ren or Stimpy or both,
alternating between the two between lives and levels.  You start out with
three
Rens and three Stimpys, each with 6 hit points.  You gain hit points by
picking
up different things, like bags of Gritty Kitty Cat Litter and various
foodstuffs.  If you can jump on the back of a Croc-O-Stimpy, you get an extra
life.  There are also other weapons you can pick up along the way, like toast
and a remote control.  The "Boss" levels are challenging, requiring somewhat
complex patterns in order to avoid being hit.  However, you can manage to
scrape
by without a pattern in all except the last one.  The one thing about the
game
that I didn't particularly like was that the passwords for each level
automatically give you three Rens and three Stimpys with 6 H.P.  each,
whether
or not you completed the last one with more or less than this (most often
less).
So if you use the passwords, it makes the game easier to get through.  If you
want a real challenging game which will last a while, don't use them.  This
game
is definitely a must for Ren & Stimpy fans.  I hope they come up with a
sequel.

Defenders of Oasis

Developer: SEGA
Cartridge Size: 4 Megabits
Battery Backup Games: Yes
Type of Game: RPG
Retail Price: $29.99
Rating: 4/5

Defenders of Oasis is a new RPG for Game Gear. The graphics and combat/spell
system are easy to use and understand. The game itself has a great depth of
detail (despite having completed the quest, there are myriad items I have
not found, or have not found how to use), and the various inhabitants are
reasonably informative and amusing.

The game itself has only one drawback, the rate of random encounters is
far too high, and indeed gets quite annoying when trying to solve the
various puzzles. Despite this, DoA is an enjoyable game, with plenty of
playtime, and even after having beaten the game, the notion of starting
over to explore further is appealing.

Reviewer: Dave Weinstein

Defenders of Oasis (4MBit,3 Battery Backup Slots) compares well to other
portable RPG's IMHO.  I've completed it last weekend, and I was very pleased
with the storyline (which pulled me in immediately), beautiful graphics and
the
nice music.  DoO plays and feels much like the Final Fantasy Series games on
the
GB; you have to talk to some townspeople sometimes, get a few hints there,
then
journey through the land to find a specific location, enter the dungeon(s),
retrieve some items, then return to the town and so on.  All towns, maps and
dungeons are shown in bird's eye view btw; fighting monsters is similar to
FinalFantasy or Shining in the Darkness on MD.  The only drawbacks are a
relatively short selection of items/weapons in the game, and that you can not
construct party members by yourself; certain persons enter your party
automatically while the game progresses.  This makes the game very
straight-forward - you can't screw up by missing the storyline or lacking
some
necessary items.  Anyways, if you are looking for a nice RPG on your 'Gear,
give
it a try.

Chakan

Developer: Sega
Type of Game: Action
Rating: 2/5

I just bought this game.  And I've only toyed with it for about an hour.  My
first impression is:  Bleach.  Two stars out of five.  Spend your money
elsewhere.  Chakan is a platform action fantasy game.  You play Chakan, a
sword-weilding sorcerer who needs to defeat 6 bosses in 6 different planes.
Chakan can move left and right, jump, roll, attack and use magic.  (Sonic
with a
weapon.)  It seems like it is probably the result of a quick-and-dirty port
over
to the GameGear from Genesis.  The graphics are nice, but dark characters on
a
black background are hard to see on a GameGear.  Chakan can overlap with the
enemies, and takes a lot of damage in doing so.  A Bad Thing (tm).  The
visual
responses can be misleading and unintuitive.  (After attacking a minotaur for
a
while, he seemed to be blowing up into a bunch of boulders.  Attacking?
 Dying?
No, evidently an avalanche.)  There is too much unavoidable random damage you
have to take during the game.  Eg., Some stalactites *randomly* drip lava,
damage you *have* to take.  In the end, the game is too hard for my taste.
 This
is coming from someone who cruised through Chuck Rock, found Ax Battler just
right, and took about ten sonics to figure out a reliable way to kill the Ant
Lion in Sonic II.

The Simpson's: Bart vs the Space Mutants

Developer: Flying Edge
Battery Backup Games: No
Type of Game: Adventure
Retail Price: $39.99
Rating: 2/5

First let me state that I am a big Simpson's fan.  I was quite excited when I
saw that this game was available for the Game Gear.  I was quickly
disapointed.
The game is based on the very popular Simpson's TV show.  The world is in
danger
of being taken over by Space Mutants.  As Bart Simpson you must foil the
alien's
plans by collecting various items that the Mutants need to complete their
Doom's
Day machine.  There are 5 separate levels that you must complete, with a
"boss"
at the end of each level.  In order to complete a level you need to collect,
destroy or change certain type of items.  In the first level you have to
spray
paint or destroy any purple colored items.  Bart can accquire and use bottle
rockets, spray paint cans and cherry bombs.  After trashing the required
number
of items Bart has to face the "boss" enemy, who is usually one of the many
other
characters from the Simpsons.  If Bart gets enough "Proof" that there are
aliens, one of the Simpsons family members will help Bart fight the Boss.
 Even
though the game is based on a pretty good concept there are many problems.
First, the levels tend to be "flat".  You can walk from one end to the other
but
there is very little else to "explore".  Only the last level, the Nuclear
Power
Plant , has multiple "floors" which are accessed via elevator.  You can enter
stores at the mall and on the street to buy things, but you always get the
outside view.  The controls were also poorly designed.  To get Bart to jump
really high, you have to hit both the 1 and 2 buttons together (rather than
pushing up on the D pad while jumping).  To select an item for use from the
inventory you have to use the D pad to cycle through the list and press the 1
button while pressing down on the D pad.  This makes it rather difficult to
select items quickly.  Many operations had to be performed in a very specific
way.  For example, to call out Grampa with the whistle, you have to be in the
exact spot for it to work.  You cannot be one step off in any direction.
Finally, the one problem that really got to me was the bugs in the game.  I
found 3 bugs in the first level alone!  The first bug is really stupid.  You
can
buy a key that can be used to "warp" within a level.  If you use the key in
the
wrong place the game crashes.  My problem with this is that you don't know
where
to use the key except by experimentation, which means that you crash the game
a
lot.  The next bug only happened once.  While using the phone to make a crank
call to Moe's Tavern the game just "bombed" out to the title screen.  The
third
bug, which actually may be a feature, is that when you are fighting the
"boss"
at the end of the level you will never lose.  You get killed, but it never
subtracts from the number of lives you have so you can fight until you win
(at
least on the first level).  All in all this is a very boring game.  In fact
it
is the only game that I have ever returned because I though it was so poorly
done.  The graphics are uninspired and the music is moronic.  Two of my
friends,
who are not video gamers both remarked at how annoying the music was.  The
only
reason I gave it 2 out of 5, is because it seems to be a fairly faithful port
of
the NES and Genesis versions.

Prince of Persia

Developer: Domark/Tengen
Battery Backup Games: Uses Passwords for level selects
Type of Game: Action/Adventure
Retail Price: $34.99
Rating: 3.5/5

The premise behind this game is that the Princess has been kidnapped by the
King's evil second-in-command, Jafar.  You have been thrown into the dungeon
and
the Princess has been given 1 hour to decide if she will marry Jafar.  Your
mission is to rescue the Princess before the 1 hour time limit expires.  You
have only your wits and agility to help you navigate through the maze of
dungeons and eventually the castle.  You can also use your sword, if you can
find it, to fight off the King's guards.  First, the things I liked about
this
game.  The animation of the main character is superb.  The body movements are
very life like as you run, jump and slash you way through the dungeons.  I
also
like the password system for level selects.  There is nothing more irritating
than having to fight your way through previously conquered levels every time
you
want to play a game.  The game also provides for difficulty select by
allowing
you to vary the amount of strength your character posseses as well as being
able
to vary the time limit.  The controls are layed out pretty well too, but it
does
take a little practice to get used to switching to the "en guard" or battle
mode.  The graphics look good, though some of the objects are a bit small to
see
clearly (must be my old age).  Now for my dislikes.  First the font used for
passwords is way too small!  I mean it's so small that sometimes it's
impossible
to determine what the characters are.  I have had to experiment with many of
the
passwords in order to get them to work.  At least it tells you that you have
entered an invalid password and allows you to re-enter a new one.  Also the
manual is a bit "lite".  They give you the basic controls and set-up for the
game, but that's about it.  There is no imformation about what potions you
may
find and what effect they might have on your character, you have to
experiment a
lot.  And while the character animations are very well done, the background
graphics tend to be too repetitive and somewhat boring.  What can you expect
from a dungeon??  This game emphasizes adventure and exploration over action.
The "fight" sequences are fairly straightforward, you thrust and parry until
you
kill your attacker.  There is also a lot of puzzle solving in that you have
to
figure out how to get out of the dungeon level you are currently on.  Many
times
this involves triggering the proper switch to open the exit door or executing
certain manuveurs in a limited amount of time.  Sometimes it seems like there
is
too much emphasis on timing and accuracy versus "solving" the puzzle and the
controls seem to be a bit slow at times.  Still the game is fun to play.  But
with a little more attention to detail like varied enemies and a "boss" at
the
end of each level this game would be great instead of better than average.

Crystal Warriors

Developer: SEGA
Battery Backup Games: Yes
Type of Game: Strategy/RPG
Retail Price: $29.99
Rating: 4/5

This cartridge combines elements of both role playing and combat strategy
games,
blending them into an enjoyable, though straightforward, adventure.  In the
game, you play a princess out to defeat an evil army ravaging her land.  Four
crystals were used for centuries to maintain the peace.  Now three of these
have
fallen into the hands of the enemy, and it's your responsibility to regain
them.
Fail to do so, or die in the process, and your people are doomed.  Gameplay
centers around a set of 16 battles, each separated by a visit to a local town
to
rest, shop, gain information, and acquire new party members.  Each battle is
progressively more difficult, testing your strategy, use of terrain, and
understanding of your party's abilities.  You may choose to save your game in
one of three slots during your visit to each town (at the completion of each
battle).  Several different classes of characters are represented, though
they
fall into the basic categories of fighter, mage, and priest.  The game's
combat
system is governed by a relational system among four elements:  earth, wind,
fire, and water.  Each fighter is aligned with an element, while spellcasters
have access to spells grounded in each of the different elements.  Fire is
superior over wind, wind superior over water, and water superior over fire.
Earth, the element of spellcasters, is equal to all other elements.  An
understanding of this system is critical to victory in the game.  Both
spellcasting and the distribution of items are simplistic.  As you progress
in
levels, the available spells and items simply become more effective.  Items
are
either armor or weapons, so selection is straightforward.  Spellcasters may
only
hold four spells at a time, so care must be taken to choose the spells
appropriate to your needs.  Party composition is generally open-ended.  You
can
choose to hire or decline any of the candidates you meet in town.  Though
your
party can consist of a maximum of only nine characters during battle, you may
hire as many as you can afford, specifying which nine of your party you wish
to
use at each battle.  Another nice touch is the use of female as well as male
characters.  Over half of my party and nearly all of my strong fighters were
women, a change from male-dominated games like Prince of Persia or Defenders
of
Oasis.  Another element of interest is the use of tamed monsters.  Throughout
the game, chracters encounter monsters on the battlefield.  If a fighter can
defeat a monster, they'll tame it into service.  This monster can then be
used
to fight in place of the master character.  As monsters are all aligned with
one
of the four elements, strategic taming of certain elemental monsters by
certain
elemental characters can provide a significant strategic advantage.  A
two-player, gear-to-gear mode is supported, though I've never tried this.
Strategy is certainly the best element of this game.  There are no puzzles
and
no real character development (a la Defenders of Oasis).  The graphics are
clear, colorful, and reminiscent of Japanese Anime and Manga.  The sound is
excellent, and the different fight themes are catchy, though sometimes
repetitive.  Battles are more like individual games of chess than RPG combats
-
placement of key characters, use of tamed monsters, and strategic strikes by
spellcasters can mean the difference between life and death.  Overall, I've
enjoyed this game to a large degree, as have both my 16 year old sister and
my
23 year old girlfriend.  A four out of five rating.

Marble Madness

Developer: ????
Battery Backup Games: No
Type of Game: Strategy/Arcade
Retail Price: $24.99
Rating: 3/5

Marble Madness is an adaptation of an older arcade game.  In the game, you
attempt to guide a marble through a series of levels, avoiding drops, sloped
pathways, hammers, moving floors, and evil black marbles.  In most respects,
this is the same as the arcade game, with a little less control and more
simplistic levels.  The game provides 6 boards plus a trial board.  For each
board, you are provided with a timelimit.  Extra time carries over to the
next
board.  Losing your marble results in loss of time and hampered progress.
 The
graphics are well done, as are the sounds.  Colors are bright and shading is
effective.  Control can be a bit tricky without the arcade's trackball,
though
two methods of control are offered on the setup screen.  Though nine levels
of
difficulty are provided, the game can be tricky at even the lower levels,
proving frustrating to some.  High scores are recorded but not saved beyond
powerdown.  Overall, a three out of five rating.

Dragon Crystal

Developer: ????
Battery Backup Games: No
Type of Game: RPG
Retail Price: $24.99
Rating: 1/5

Dragon Crystal is an attempt to port a nethack-like RPG to the Game Gear.  In
the game, you play an adventurer exploring a multilevel dungeon.  Accompanied
by
your pet dragon (initially in an egg), you fight monsters, collect items, and
descend dungeon levels.  While this game provides attractive graphics and
adequate sound, the play is shallow and appears unfinished.  There are only a
few items in the game, and the documentation describes none of them.  Levels
are
always structured similarly, in the room/corridor fashion, with no
distinguishing features on any of the levels.  Gameplay is reminiscent of
early
Hack or Rouge type games, but with fewer items, fewer action choices, and
less
variety.  Another gripe is the implementation of your pet dragon.  Your pet
begins in an egg, following you as you explore.  At a certain level of
experience, the egg hatches into a baby dragon, which grows with your
experience
level.  Unfortunately, the dragon never does anything for you besides follow
your footsteps.  The critical drawback to Dragon Crystal is its inability to
store a game.  Because the dungeon is deep, you have to spend a long play
session to get anywhere in the game, longer still to complete it.  Critical
design flaws like this are evident on multiple levels, making this a
disappointing cartridge.  A one out of five rating.

Columns

Developer: SEGA
Battery Backup Games: No
Type of Game: Strategy
Retail Price: $24.99
Rating: 4/5

This is the original cartridge packaged with the Game Gear, previous to
Sonic.
It's an implementation of the columns arcade and PC game, with colorful
graphics, nice sound, and good control.  The object of the game is to
eliminate
falling 3x1 columns (a la Tetris) as they pile up in your playing field.  To
eliminate a column (or portion of one), three or more segments of a column
must
align with the same color.  Though apparently similiar in nature to Tetris,
the
strategy for Columns is completely different, centered more on setting up
chain-reaction eliminations than fitting pieces to form complete rows.  The
game
allows you to configure the level of difficulty, beginning level of play
(speed
at which the columns fall), block type (gem, dice, card suit, colored block,
or
fruit), and background music.  Besides the standard game of columns where you
attempt to survive as long as possible (until the columns pile to the top of
your playing area), you can choose to play a variation called Flash.  Flash
Columns differs from standard columns in that the object is to eliminate a
specific flashing block buried beneath several layers of columns.  Depending
on
the level of play, this can be exteremely tricky.  Finally, Columns allows a
two-player head-to-head mode using the gear-to-gear connector cable.  I've
never
tried this, though it looks particularly fun as all blocks eliminated from
your
screen appear on your opponent's screen.  This is a simple yet addicting game
that will provide long-term playability.  It's easy to understand and a good
quick game.  A four out of five.

Slider

Developer: Infogrames
Battery Backup: No/Password level select
Type of Game: Strategy
Retail Price: ??
Rating: 3/5

Slider is a strategy game where you must move you character "Slider" across
the
world of Rozen and turn all the tiles pink.  Each of the 99 levels is more
challenging than the previous.  Some are simple if you just figure out the
pattern you must move in.  While you are trying to accomplish this goal, you
are
being pursued by all sorts of villans.  Ghosts, menaces, slipsters, boppers,
tentacles, crashers, and painters.  It is a constant challenge to keep moving
to
avoid the monsters, while turning all the tiles pink by walking over them
before
the clock runs out.  This is a very entertaining game, well worth it if
bought
used.

Spiderman: Return of the Sinister Six

I bought that new Spider-Man - Return of the Sinister Six cartridge for Game
Gear last week, and let me say that IT IS CRAP!!!  The characters are all
really
small and funny-looking.  The difficulty level is pretty average, and I was
able
to finish the game pretty quickly, after getting used to a couple of annoying
things about it.  One of these annoying things was that you have to be at an
exact distance from the enemy in order to punch him.  If you're too close,
your
punches go right through them (but the okay thing is that they can't punch
you
either), and if you're too far, you definitely can't hit them, although they
CAN
shoot at you.  This can be irritating as hell!  Another thing that bugged me
was
that when you press the punch/fire button, there's a slight delay before the
punch/fire occurs.  I guess this is because hitting the punch button once is
a
punch and hitting it twice is a kick, and the game has to differentiate
between
punches and kicks, even though the kicks are pretty unnecessary, anyway.

Mortal Kombat

I'm not a big fan of the Game Gear.  I bought one almost 2 years ago to add
to
my collection but have only bought one game since then (Devilish).  Today, on
an
impulse (because it looked so good) I bought Mortal Kombat ($42.95 or so) for
the Game Gear.  All in all...it's a VERY impressive game.  The graphics are
SUPERB!  The amination is choppy, and there is a fair bit of flicker, but
really...what do you expect from a Game Gear?  I've played all of the
versions
except the GameBoy one and I'll say...  this is the most impressive.  Why?
Because what they've done with the hardware...this is an amazing
representation
of the arcade game.  I haven't tried the blood code yet, but most of the
moves
are there, but Kano was taken out (most likely for memory reasons).  The
music
is pretty good....considering the system..  and the gameplay is a tad easy
(but
gets hard on the later levels...  the difficulty is adjustable, however.).
 You
can play 2 player with the Gear to Gear cable as well..  Oh ya, Start
blocks...
and the 1/2 buttons do Punch and Kick (no high/low here..).  This is great, a
must have for all GG owners...  this is to the GG what Blue Lightining is to
the
Lynx...  the ultimate show-off game.  Get it..!

Reviewer: Ralph Barbagallo

I picked up Mortal Kombat for the Game Gear yesterday, Wow!  The graphics are
amazing and the control is excellent.  It's not as easy as playing the
arcade,
but it plays very well and the fatalities are easy to pull off.  There are
some
minor annoyances.  Obviously, the sound isn't there, but they did a pretty
good
job with music considering what they had to work with.  There are only two
backgrounds, one being the pit.  In the pit stage, you can't knock the guy
off
the ledge with an uppercut, I'll just have to settle for ripping his head and
spine out of his body.  Last but not least, Kano isn't there.  It makes sense
since it's difficult to do the 360 with the Game Gear's pad.  I'm sure it
wouldn't be worth the bother.  I have to say, I've very impressed.  If you
have
a Game Gear, go buy it!  Also, if you get the Super Wide Gear to magnify the
screen, it's that much better.

Addams Family

I think the game Addams Family is only so-so.  The Graphics are not very
good,
the levels are picky about positioning the character--for example, to go up
the
house stairs to the attic, you have to wiggle your character around to get it
positioned +- 2 or 3 pixels to go up the plainly obvious stairs.  This can
take
30 seconds, but doesn't have any bearing on the game.  If a precision jump is
required, I can understand that.  You can only play as Gomez.  You have to
listen to the addams theme incessantly--only if something really different is
happening do you get any other music.  The other sound effects are cheesy.
Chirps and beeps only.  I must like it some--I keep playing it (I got it 3
days
ago) I like that you can choose where to go next--you don't get forced into
level 1, level2, etc.  You can wander thru the mansion and pick your fights
as
you wish.  I would give it 2 stars, I guess.

Gregor_Harrison@atk.com

My first impression of the game is basically a simple platform game.  You are
Gomez and you try to find all the family members is the object of the game.
 Its
a puzzle/adventure game.  To kill monsters you have to jump on top of them
like
Super Mario.  I personally didn't like the game because you have to jump
around
obstacles and platforms.

Sonic Chaos

I've just recently purchased both Star Wars, and Sonic Chaos(and one of the
"Super Wide Gear" Sega magnifiers).  Both games are excellent.  Sonic has a
couple new moves, plus the use of rocket sneakers(go flying for about 5
seconds
in the rocket shoes), and you can also play as Tails, who by spinning his
tail
will fly.

Darrell Spice Jr.

To put it as a simple summary, this game is similar to Sonic II from the
Genesis
version.  The game is very,very simple with Tails, and its just as easy with
Sonic.  Points, xtra guys, and continues rack up very quickly.  I used Tails
with just 2 continues to finish the game.  Very easy to finish the game.
Graphics and sound are always good but, I find Sonic II for GG is more
challenging.

Star Wars

Star Wars is extremely well done, and interlaced with little movie extracts
between the levels.  The levels follow the movie Star Wars.  You start out as
Princess Leia when Darth Vader and his group first get on her ship.  You have
to
make your way to R2-D2 to give him the message to take to ObiWan.  Then you
play
as Luke chasing after the run-away R2-D2, track down ObiWan, find Han Solo,
get
to the death star, ect.  I'm up to the point of rescueing Princess Leia (on
the
"Cadet" level- haven't tried very far on the Jedi level yet.  :-) ).

Darrell Spice Jr.

A pretty good adventure/action game by US Gold.  This is a platform and
shoot'em
up type of game.  Music is very good.  This is a 4 Megabit game so it is very
huge.  You can play Luke, Han Solo, and Princess Leia.  This is a fun game
since
you can pilot the Millenium Falcon into the Astroid Belt, and you can pilot
the
X-wing fighter into the Death Star.  The only bad point in the game is that
there is not password.

Keith Ng -  "The coolest guy on the face of this world!"

Star Wars is very good.  Difficult at first and then even more difficult on
Jedi
mode.  It isn't totally true to the movie, but stays fairly close to the
plot.
It has great cinema scenes and involves you.  It has good music, electronic
versions of the real music.  ****

Ecco the Dolphin
This is a nicely done conversion of the genesis version.  Even though it
doesn't have as many levels, the storyline is same as the Genesis version.
The graphics are good and so is the sound & music.  Just listen to Ecco
squeal at the title screen.  This is a puzzle game, as Ecco you must find
entrances to the next level.  The controls are the following: 1- ram,
2-swim faster, start-shoot a ecco (hold start to show map).  It has a
password screen so you don't have to worry about starting from the
beginning.

Dr. Robotniks Mean Bean Machine (Review)

When I first saw the box, I thought this game was a boring Columns type a
game.
Then I played the game on the Genesis and I actually liked it and so I rented
it
on the Game Gear.  Boy was I wrong, this has gotta be one of the best games
I've
played on the Game Gear.  The story is very simple:  Dr.  Robotnik is
converting
all the beans of Mobius into his mechanized droids and you must stop it.
 There
are several options you can play:  Scenario, Gear-to-Gear, Puzzle.  Scenario
mode is you play the computer.  Gear-to-Gear is you play against a fellow GG
and
puzzle is you have to figure out how to do the techniques of eliminating the
beans given a certain problem.

The game:  2 beans fall at a time, you can rotate the beans clockwise or
counter-clockwise.  Press down to drop them down quickly.  If you can join 4
or
more beans stringed together of the same color it will disappear.  The idea
is
to try to sink chains of beans with the same color.  The more chains of beans
you sink in Scenario mode the more beans you shove to the opponent.  Its
acutally a fun game if you can create chains of beans.  I liked the game so
I'd
give it 5/5.  The music and sounds are great!

NBA JAM

NBA JAM is another great game from the folks at Acclaim. This game is fun to
play and compares quite well to its 16 bit counterparts. Obviously the
sampled
voices are out and the music is a bit moronic, but the overall playability is
quite good. The graphics are well done, especially for the small screen.
There
is the occasional "flicker" when too many sprites try to occupy the same spot
on the screen. All of the power-ups from the arcade are included such as
Power-Up Dunks, Power-Up Intercept, Shot Percentage, Power-Up Defense and
Juice
Mode. It is rumoured that the special players like Bill Clinton and Al Gore
are
there, but I have yet to be able to access them. While not a true basketball
"simulation" (you only play 2 on 2), this is a fast paced fun game to play.
Overall I would rate this 8 out of 10 with a high replayability factor.
