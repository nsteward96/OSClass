** What is CHEAT?


CHEAT is a listing of cheats for IBM/MS-DOS computer games.  Debugging
commands, secret commands, and whatever else can enable you to cheat
in these games.

However, you won't find any level codes or trainer-style programs
here... they aren't real cheats.



** How do I load the program?


At the command prompt (that thing that looks remotely like C:\>) type
CHEAT and press enter.

On screen instructions are given from that point on.  I hope it's
self-explanatory....



** Where do I report bugs, comments, suggestions, and
** submissions?


The official support BBS is The Cult of the Tentacle.  A 28.8k modem is
online 24 hours a day to serve your gaming needs.

You can also freq CHEAT from 1:272/169.



** Disclaimer


I cannot be held responsible for the results of any cheats described
in this list.  In most cases, the game companies intended these cheats
for internal use only, they have the chance of being destructive.
Known limitations are listed, when possible .

As for this program, if it blows up your computer, I am not
responsible for that either.  Sorry.
