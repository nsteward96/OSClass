 UPDATES: 1. GameBoy mail-server and mailing list! <--*YEAH*
          2. Mortal Kombat cheats
          3. Yet more cheats, codes and passwords
           
 I finally found some time to update the FAQ. Sorry for the huge
 delay, this semester was a busy one for me. Anyway, here is a
 new v.2.0 of the FAQ.

 People, could somebody subscribing for "Electronic Gaming World" 
 and other similar magazines go through the "S.W.A.T." sections in
 them and write down all GameBoy cheats/passwords/etc. not included
 into this file? I would appreciate your help. 
 As always, FAQ may contain errors. Also, some information is 
 missing. If you find an error or have a missing piece of information,
 email your comments to me. Notice that this file contains some data
 on GameBoy's internals. Any additional information in this field
 will also be greatly appreciated (read "Unanswered Questions" section).

 
  
**************** I. GameBoy: General Description ******************
 
    CPU: 8-bit Z80 at 2.2 MHz
    RAM: 16kB internal
    ROM: 512kBit, 1MBit, 2MBit and 4MBit cartridges are known
         (64kB, 128kB, 256kB and 512kB). Probably, there are 
    smaller kinds as well (16kB and 32kB).
    
    Sound: 4 Channels (Stereo: 2L/2R)
    
    Video: 
      Display: Reflective LCD 160x144 dots
      Colors:  4 shades of gray
      Sprites: 8 sprites 8x8 

    Communications: Serial port (?) 
      Up to 4 Gameboys can be connected together using these ports
      Baud rate: ???
      Protocol:  ???
      
    Power: 6 Volts, 0.7 Watts 
      4 AA Batteries             - 35 hours
                       OR
      Rechargable battery (NAKI) - 12 hours
           
* What are an advantage of GB in comparison with other portable videogames?

    The same reflective LCD screen which is considered to be the weak point
  of GameBoy, is its advantage. Other systems, such as Atari Lynx or SEGA
  GameGear, use backlighted color screens which consume several times more
  power than reflective LCD of GB. Thus, these systems need 6 AA batteries
  instead of 4 AAs needed by GB and drain these batteries in about 6 hours.
  Also, dots on GB's LCD are much smaller than dots on the color screens of
  other portables which [given that you have a good light source nearby]
  means that GB's LCD looks crisper. The other advantage of GameBoy is that
  it is the only portable videogame you can actually PUT INTO YOUR POCKET. 
  Both Lynx and GameGear are too big for it.
    Speaking about variety of games available for GB, I would *NOT*
  consider it an advantage of GB if we are talking solely about its
  technical characteristics. Amount of software written for the system has
  nothing to do with the system's hardware architecture. It is rather
  determined by commercial success of the system and [in fact] by how it
  is marketed. There are many technologically superior systems which just
  didn't make it because of poor marketing [TurboGrafx is an example].

9. Possible cheat in Final Fantasy Legend II:

   On some stage of the game double-clicking on the Trashcan [or, maybe,
   trying to "move" Trashcan to the different position in the list] will
   allow to increase Agility or Strength of the party members. This trick
   appeared only once and I couldn't repeat it. I also got responses from  
   two people who encountered similar effect. Everybody who has more info
   on this trick, send email to me.

***************************** IV. Game Genie ****************************

1. How it works?

  GameGenie allows you to substitute some of the codes in the cartridge
  ROM with your own codes. For example, you can substitute the default 
  number of lives with your own number. GameBoy GameGenie allows to 
  substitute up to three codes.

2. Where to get the codes?

  GameBoy GameGenie codes are available through anonymous FTP at
  
        netcom.com     directory  /pub/vidgames/gamegenie

3. What is the meaning of the digits in GameGenie code for GameBoy?

  * All digits are in hexadecimal system

         GameBoy GameGenie Code:     DD2-103-???
         
         DD         - Data Byte
         0,1,2,3    - Address, reads as 3210     
         ???        - Meaning of these digits is unknown.
                      It is suspected that they represent the
                      ROM paging register, but no information
                      is available.
         
   Example: 3D2-ABF-3BE - Set 3Dh (DEC A command) at address F2ABh 
           
4. Some commonly used Z80 instructions with their codes:

  Code(s):  Instruction:       Common Usage:   
   3Eh xxh  - LD A,xxh    Load default number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   3Dh      - DEC A       Decrease number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   3Ch      - INC A       Increase number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   00h      - NOP         DO NOTHING (set this instead of 3Dh)

5. CodeMasters' address and phone number:

********************* V. Programming, Hardware, etc. *******************

1. Are there any GameBoy emulators for the personal computers?
  
  YES, there is a GameBoy emulator for the Commodore Amiga called ToyBoy.
  This emulator can be obtained by FTP from AmiNet sites:
  
  ftp.luth.se:           /pub/aminet/misc/emu/Gameboy68000.lha
  ftp.etsu.edu:          /aminet/misc/emu/GameBoy68000.lha
  wuarchive.wustl.edu:   /systems/amiga/aminet/misc/emu/Gameboy68000.lha
  
  Unfortunately, this package is incomplete. It doesn't have documentation
  and a Z80 assembler. The author of ToyBoy is unknown. According to some
  sources, ToyBoy was stolen from a company called Argonaut developing
  Amiga->GameBoy cross-development system for Nintendo. Other rumors say
  that there is a demo console based on this emulator. The ToyBoy package
  found on Aminet includes:  
 
          a)  GameBoy emulator
          b)  Binary file for Tetris which can be run by emulator
          c)  Source code of Tetris in Z80 assembler  

  Following information was mainly obtained by exploring the Tetris source
  code which came with ToyBoy. Information about GameBoy's hardware is
  extremely hard to find. Most of it is incomplete, uncertain and vague.
  If you have any information [especially about things listed in 
  "Unanswered Questions" section], PLEASE, email it to fms@wam.umd.edu.
  
  
2. Addresses of GameBoy I/O ports:

  GameBoy seems to access I/O ports as memory cells rather than as real Z80
  I/O ports i.e. instead of IN A,(Port#) we have LD A,(Port Addr). Here are
  several port addresses and their usage:
  
  
  EA64h: Joystick (INPUT)
  
    Bits:   Meaning:              When buttons are pressed, appropriate 
     0        [LEFT]              bits go to "1"s
     1        [RIGHT]
     2        [UP]
     3        [DOWN]
     4        [A]
     5        ?
     6        ?
     7        ?
     
     
  EA62h/EA63h: Low/High bytes of the Character Set address (OUTPUT)
  
    Using these two ports you can set an address of the Character Set
    table for GameBoy's video controller. This address should be EVEN(?).
    There may be up to 256 (?) characters 8x8 dots each. Character's 
    pattern takes 16 bytes. Each dot has two bits in two consequent bytes:
    
        Addr:    db 00010000b
                       | |
                       +------------> Dot with color 2 (10b)
                       | +----------> Dot with color 1 (01b)
                       | |
        Addr+1:  db 00001100b
    
    Here is an example of the character using colors 0 and 2 only:
                         
                         db 00000000b,0     
                         db 01111100b,0
                         db 11001110b,0
                         db 11011110b,0
                         db 11110110b,0
                         db 11100110b,0
                         db 11000110b,0
                         db 01111100b,0
                      
    Let C be a code of the character. Then the pattern of this character
    in the table will be located at                   
                      
                PattAddr(C)=CharSetAddr+16*C
                                |
                                +---> This is the address in EA62h/EA63h
                                          
                         
  EA60h/EA61h: Low/High bytes of the Character Map address (OUTPUT)

    These ports define the address of the table video controller uses as
    a Character Map. This 20x18 table contains codes of the characters
    being displayed on the screen. Let X,Y be coordinates of the character
    (starting at the left-upper corner). Then the address of this character
    in the table will be
    
                CharAddr(X,Y)=CharMapAddr+20*Y+X
                                  |
                                  +---> This is the address in EA60h/EA61h
                                      
                                      
3. Is it possible to build a backlight into GameBoy?

  NO, it is impossible to make a backlight for the reflective LCD. 
  Nevertheless, it is possible to put a light source inside GameBoy so
  that it will be above the screen. Don't forget that opening GameBoy will
  void the warranty though.

4. Are there any game copiers for GameBoy?

  No stand-alone game copiers are known. Nevertheless, there seem to be
  GameBoy adaptors for MultiGameDoctorII, MultiGameHunter, SuperWildCard
  and SuperComPro. Also, there is a device allowing to play games stored
  on credit card-like magnetic cards which is produced in Japan and isn't
  sold in U.S.

5. MultiGame cartridges for GameBoy:

  Yes, these cartridges are at least half-illegal because their producers
  violate copyright law.
  Yes, these things exist for GameBoy. At present time, there are four
  kinds of them: 48in1, 64in1, 86in1 and 105in1 (although there were rumors
  about 200in1 cartridge also). They all seem to contain the same basic set
  of games most of which are either old Nintendo products (like Alleyway or
  Tennis) or low-quality games from other companies with a couple of good
  games added. Number of games in such a cartridge is actually SMALLER than
  it is written on the box because some games are present in two or three
  copies (with a number of lives and other things changed). For example,
  64in1 cartridge contains only about 48 DISTINCT games. At least 27 of
  them can be classified as "logic" or "strategy" games. There were many
  requests to list games multigame cartridges contain. So, here is a list
  of games how it appears in a menu of a 105in1 cartridge. Other multigame
  cartridges contain subset of games listed below. Notice large number of
  japanese titles and repetitions. There are also some titles which actually
  respond to the same game.

6. Using GameGenie with multigame cartridges:

  No, GameGenie DOES NOT WORK with multigame cartridges.  

7. Japanese cartridges:

  These are cartridges which are not available in U.S., although you can
  find them if you are lucky. Following descriptions of japanese cartridges
  were prepared by Mark Kaufman.

* Name: Parodius                     Type: Shooter     Producer: Konami  
  Graphics: 10       Sound: 10       Playability: 10   Overall: 10

  This is the legendary Japanese shooter to which all others are compared.
  It is awesome, huge, creative, challenging and fun, fun, fun.

* Name: Twinbee                      Type: Shooter     Producer: Konami
  Graphics:  9       Sound:  9       Playability:  9   Overall:  9

  Another Japanese cart that should be sold over here.  It's better than
  90% of all GB games.

8. Why some GameGenie codes don't work?

  Some games exist in several different versions. Although these versions
  look exactly the same, the actual program codes differ. Therefore, while
  some GameGenie codes work with one version of the cartridge, they aren't
  guaranteed to work with other versions.

9. Where is GB Zelda FAQ?

13. Which games are best to buy?
   You can use a list of best games included into this FAQ-file. It is
   incomplete and quite biased though. To get most recent information,
   send email containing a single word get_gameboy to 
   paien00@dmi.usherb.ca to get "Nick's GameBoy Game Ratings" list. It
   also seems to be biased, but let's hope that it will look better
   when more people contribute to it.

14. Mail-server and mailing list for GameBoy:
   They are maintained by M. S. Manley. The address for both is
   
                     gameboy@mentor.cc.purdue.edu

   Try fingering this address to get more info.

   In order to access mail-server, send email with subject "archive"
   and body containing a list of commands. At the beginning, you can
   send a letter containing only one word: "help" and the server
   will send you a help-file with the list of all available commands.

   In order so subscribe for the mailing list, send email with subject
   "subscribe". You can include your email address in the letter body,
   otherwise it will be taken from the header. All other mail sent
   to the above-described address and not containing keywords
   "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "help" or "archive" will be forwarded to
   the mailing list.

   My personal thanks to M.S.Manley. =:)
