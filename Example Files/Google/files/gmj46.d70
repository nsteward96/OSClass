   You never really know how big this country is until you travel it via the
 trains.  Hi gang, it's Ace back again for another episode of Ace's Angles.
   Amtrak is a great way to relax, play some Game Boy [my Lynx was packed by
 accident] and think about how good things are with the magazine.  Issue 46,
 the CES coming up... and no issues for a month.
   Wait, a month?!  Yep, sorry about the delay but we are BACK and BETTER than
 ever.  And wait until issue 50!  Can you say, Front End?
   But enough about that, lets get to the rumors!
   Mortal Kombat II for the Super NES?  Yes, that's a given.  But without the
 blood?  HELL NO!  With Williams' new deal with Nintendo [see NEWS, below]
 rumor has it that there will be no stopping the pit this time.  NOA the
 upcoming rating system will be in place by the time it's released.  We have
 heard conflicting reports: August and October 15th have both been given as THE
 day.
   Street Fighter for the Jag?  Could it be?  YES.  Super Street Fighter II
 Turbo should hit the Jag first, even before the Super NES.  And here's why:
 Capcom has got to be unhappy with NOA's deal with Williams.  Capcom has never
 been happy with their games on the Genesis.  So.. JAGUAR TIME!
   Well, got deadlines to meet.  Cya's at Blockbuster's World Game Tourney!

**     Get Your Hands On The Single Best Summer CES Resource Available!    **
*****************************************************************************

     TNT: The only great way to get Summer Consumer Electronics Show coverage.

     Less than a month ago, someone suggested the possibility that the editors
of the Internet's game magazinen could team up and produce a single incredible
Internet resource. At the time, the idea seemed impossible -- besides the
logistic problems, why eliminate the quality competitive atmosphere currently
in place?
     That's when it happened. After Team Renegade announced TNT (The Next
Thing) magazine, we received tons of E-mail from interested writers, supporters
and customers. The editors of Game Master Journal, Intelligent Gamer and 
VidBits
have all generously endorsed TNT as a true success in the making (and we didn't
even have to ask them! *grin*). TNT also has an extremely high-caliber staff
including many of the Internet's most talented (and thus popular) writers.
We just can't lose.
     Renegade Technologies Unlimited has spent the last several weeks handling
orders, organizing the TNT staff and preparing to expand our sales outwards
into local game stores. We're taking orders from as far away as Germany and
from places as close as Maine. Why so much interest? Because we're going to
deliver what the major game magazines cannot: Comprehensive coverage of the
Summer CES, which means you'll get detailed information on almost every video
game to hit the shelves in the next 6-12 months. Photographs. Articles.
Real analysis, not just some paragraph off the back of the game box.
     Here's the story. Take a look back at some of your old game magazines.
How much CES coverage did you find? 10 pages? Maybe 15 at best? I have three
words for you: You've been screwed. Ever wonder why the major gaming mags
can only squeeze a few pages of information out of a show that lasts for
three or four days? Answer: Their "writers" don't pay much attention. Snap a
picture, make up a 30-word synopsis, and that's what the game was like at CES.
     If you believe that every video game is worth thirty words and a photo,
you deserve what you've been getting. Stop reading now and go back to sleep
until you're woken up by the crowds rioting at the local K-Mart for their
home versions of Ridge Racer. Otherwise, read on and discover why your world
is about to change dramatically for the better.
     The last CES yielded at least four huge packed bags full of literature,
press kits and neat information that often never appeared in the mainstream
gaming magazines. Best yet, RTU made the information available immediately
while conducting IRC discussions for several nights in a row, answering any
and all questions regarding the CES. Eternal Champions fanatics heard complete
descriptions of the game's characters roughly five months before the game was
released, including two characters which never appeared in the game's final
version. Jaguar press release and video tape information was discussed far in
advance of the system's first official press conference. Gamers received
candid and honest assessments of almost every single console-based video game
on the show floor, even though the major magazines waited months to say the
exact same things RTU said.
     Now things are getting better. Team Renegade is producing a one-shot
deal for fanatic gameplayers and even your lazy buddies who are just getting
around to playing Super Mario 2. We don't need to compete with the major
gaming magazines for their CES coverage. Simply put, they suck. When you sit
down at the end of CES with a hundred photographs and fifty pounds of game
literature, it's almost laughable to consider that VideoGames gave the
show five pages and about 100 words of text. RTU is going to bring CES home
to you with our unique new magazine format devoted exclusively to the
Summer CES.
     We're calling it Project TNT: The Next Thing.

     The high-quality TNT magazine will be a hardcopy printed booklet with
many pages devoted to the show's general highlights and notable events. For the
reader's maximum enjoyment, additional computer disks [available in IBM and
Macintosh formats] will carry photographs (and perhaps digitized sound files)
from the show. Does TNT sound like it will kill your pocketbook? Here's why the
answer is no: Team Renegade set down four main goals for Project TNT;
flexibility, cost-efficiency, functionality and quick delivery. You can order
*only* the magazine if you so desire, or spend a little bit more and get
brand new high-resolution photographs far in advance of the major magazines.

[*] Flexibility: [*]   Today's gamer owns two or three systems and generally
                       despises competing companies. Do you own a 3DO and hate
                       Atari and their Jaguar? Or a Genesis and hate Nintendo?
                       Well, don't spend the money on information you'll just
                       skip anyway. The TNT magazine will be available in
                       your choice of configurations -- you pick the systems
                       you want and we'll send you the appropriate disks and
                       printed materials.

[*] Cost-Efficiency: [*]   The printed TNT magazine with CES highlights will
                           cost only $5.50, roughly what you would pay
                           for a crappy five-page synopsis in some trashy
                           mainstream magazine. Each company-specific set of
                           disks and additional printed materials will cost
                           an additional $4.50, and a disk of miscellaneous
                           photos and out-takes will also be $4.00. That
                           miscellaneous disk will include pictures from
                           companies like Sony, TTI and Commodore (if any
                           of them show up for CES). We're selling
                           Atari, Nintendo, Sega and 3DO company disks which
                           will include the aforementioned companies'
                           licensees as well. If you want to buy the whole
                           compendium of CES information, the price is $23.

[*] Functionality: [*]   IBM or Macintosh disks will be included with
                         each company-specific or miscellaneous/outtakes-
                         disk order. The photographs will be in PICT format
                         for the Macintosh (readable by any program including
                         TeachText) and .GIF format for the IBM. You'd be
                         amazed at how much high resolution detail we were
                         able to squeeze into the last Summer CES photos;
                         more, believe it or not, than could be seen without
                         a magnifying glass. The printed magazine can be
                         kept on your desk, framed above your fireplace or
                         used as a security blanket. Regardless of what you
                         do with it, it'll look cool and contain entertaining
                         insights into the real nature of the CES show.

[*] Quick Delivery: [*]   Here's the best part. Waiting sucks and no one knows
                          it better than Team Renegade and you. We're making a
                          guarantee that TNT will be released at a *maximum*
                          of three weeks after CES. We're going to try for two
                          weeks or less, but we can't control everything.
                          Remember, we're not talking about just printing
                          regurgitated press releases and press kit photos;
                          you'll see the former on the Internet within a day
                          of release to the media. TNT will feature the types
                          of nook and cranny questions no one seems to ask.

     Renegade Technologies Unlimited is committed to the production of an
exceptional piece of journalism. The TNT magazine will be both comprehensive
and professionally produced, delivered faster than the major magazines and
far more insightful for certain. RTU will be maintaining a professional
set of records for those who order TNT in advance and we make an absolute
guarantee that if we cannot deliver the product we will instantly refund
your money. Additionally, if Sega and their licensees have no presence at
the CES (which is quite doubtful in my mind), we'll refund the cost of
the Sega-specific diskettes.

EDU site (cd pub/ces and pub/pselect) for high quality photographs, game 
reviews

You'll appreciate our devotion to customer satisfaction and the degree of our
attention to properly handling your order.
     Order today and be guaranteed the best *honest* information directly
after the Summer CES. No slobbering over lame software, no ass kissing, just
the facts and the photographs to prove them.

/      Sega inks deal with MGM, Atari shows list of upcoming Jag titles       \
+-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-+
 REDWOOD CITY, Calif.  (AP) -- Sega of America Inc.  and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
 Inc.  will jointly create video games, movies and television programs.
   The companies said the new products would be based on original ideas -- a
 first for such a collaboration.  But Sega and MGM said they also may decide to
 develop games based on upcoming movie releases.
   MGM and Sega will invest undisclosed amounts in the venture, which was
 announced on Wednesday.
   "Clearly this deal allows us to blend the strengths of both companies,"
 said Alan Cole-Ford, MGM's executive vice president for strategy and
 development.
   The deal blends the studio's expertise in developing and writing stories and
 access to acting talent with Sega's technical and game-playing know how, he
 said.
   Sega and MGM said they would immediately start work on titles for Sega
 compact disk, its Genesis 32-bit cartridge player and still-in-the-works
 Saturn CD player.
   The CD games would feature real actors, whose recorded actions would respond
 to players' commands.
   "We've believed the melding of live-action video and computer technology as
 a great means of delivering a cinematic experience on an inexpensive home game
 system for some time," said Tom Kalinske, president and chief executive
 officer of Sega of America.
   The deal is not the first involving a video game company and a film studio.
 But it is the first in which such companies will collaborate from an idea to
 completed product.
   Sega, part of Sega Enterprises Ltd.  of Japan, has worked with several
 studios, including Walt Disney Co., which helped develop Sega's hit
 "Aladdin" game, which was based on the movie.
   Also on Tuesday, Warner Bros. and Acclaim Entertainment Inc.  reached an
 agreement to make video game versions of the upcoming movie "Batman
 Forever."


 SUNNYVALE, Calif.  (GMJ)  --  Atari has furnished us with a list of companies
 and the games they are working on for the Jaguar.  The list is unedited to
 show "holes" in the list as it was given to us (Atari could not give us a
 complete list, but they could tell us the incomplete parts.)
   Do not call these companies as most customer service reps will not have info
 on these games.  Stay tuned to GMJ, your Jaguar information source.

                    Ultimate Mortal Kombat II guide, part 6
                      "Chess", or choosing your character

 One of the most overlooked parts of Mortal Kombat is character selection.
 What character you pick -- and when you pick it -- is almost as important
 as knowing when to uppercut or to throw a fireball.

 First, answer a few simple questions.  Who are you good with?  Who are your
 three best and worst characters?  Can you compete using any of the 12
 characters?

 Figure out what match-up you DO NOT want for each character, and which one is
 IDEAL for each character you'll play.  You should learn several characters so
 you do not get trapped into a match-up you can't win.  Learn your strengths
 and weaknesses so you know what is coming at all times.

 Find your strong character and choose him or her often.  But don't be obvious:
 play _The Game_.  The Game is the 15 second period before the fighting starts
 where the two players choose characters.  Learn the count -- the length of
 time between you press START and your character is chosen automatically by the
 computer -- and use it to your advantage.  Learning the count will allow you
 to get the match-up YOU want, not one your foe wants.

 For instance: Lets say that you are good at Raiden.  You want to be Raiden,
 unless your foe is Liu Kang, because Raiden vs. Liu is suicide for the Thunder
 God.  So, you want to be Scorpion if he's Liu.

 OUTCOME #1:
 When you press start you are on Liu Kang, and your foe is on Reptile.  He
 moves over to Liu Kang, you move to Scorpion and press block (or any other
 button) to choose him.  Then HE moves to Jax, someone you aren't good against,
 chooses him and proceeds to trash you.  What happened?

 Well, this is a common mistake.  NEVER PICK YOUR GUY/GAL FIRST.  EVER.  This
 is how you lose.  Selecting the character first puts you at the mercy of your
 opponent, allowing him to pick his best character against the one you have
 chosen.

 OUTCOME #2:
 Instead of moving to Liu he moves to Shang Tsung.  You think "Cool!" and go
 over to Raiden, and because you have learned from your mistake from #1, you
 wait.  He doesn't want that match-up, so he moves to Liu.  You move to Scorp.
 He goes to Jax.  Time runs out, ou get thrashed.  ACK!

 You moved to your character-of-choice too soon!  This gets you in a game of
 "tag", where you pick a guy, then I do, then you move, then I do, and so on.
 This is avoided by waiting until time is about to run out, then move to your
 guy.

 OUTCOME #3:
 You wait 12 out of the 15 seconds and then move to Raiden.  You have your foe
 trapped on a wierd (to him) character, and thrash him throughly!

 Congrats - you have learned The Game.  Most people call this Chess... because
 it's all a mind game.
