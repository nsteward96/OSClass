with Winkle and climb onto the tree's  hand. Place Fingus on the rock under the
branch. Use Winkle to knock down a flower by shaking the branch and have Fingus
ready to catch it.  Use the flower on the stone under  which the bees live. Use
Fingus on the stone. When a bee flies out, Fingus will get honey. Put Fingus on
the big rock to  the left of the stone and use Winkle  on the stone to make the
bee come out. Put Fingus on the bee's  back. When the bee takes Fingus near the
nymph,  have him  give the  honey to  the nymph.  The nymph  will point out the
correct  mushroom. Pick  the mushroom  and use  Winkle to  knock on Vivalzart's
door. Show him the mushroom with Winkle and enter his house.

Problem:
Vivalzart's House.

Hint:
Put the mushroom into the machine with Winkle and activate it with Fingus. When
the machine starts, the liquid is blocked  by the clothes pin. Take a worm from
the jar  with Winkle. Place  Fingus on  the  left trap door  under the vulture.
Activate the shelf button with Winkle. This tosses Fingus to the vulture. While
Fingus is hanging, throw the worm to  the vulture with Winkle. Fingus will drop
with a  piece of meat.  Give the meat  to the piranha  who spits out  the bone.
Place a goblin on  the trash can. Take the bone and  give it to Vivalzart. When
he throws it into  the trash can, a goblin will bounce  onto the shelf. Get the

put the drumstick  on the stocking cap to  create a net. When you  activate the
spring with Fingus,  a bicycle pump appears for a  short time near the drummer.
During  this brief  period, put  Winkle's  hand  on the  headlight and  put the
bicycle pump in  inventory. Place a gobliin on the  spring. Activate the spring
with the other  goblin. The gobliins will jump  in turn and a door  on the left
will open. Go through the door.

Problem:
Water Hose.

Hint:
In the musician room,  at the top, the way is blocked by  a water hose. Use the
clothes pin on  the base of the hose  with one of the gobliins.  Go through the
bottom right hole and  speak to the guitarist. He plays and  a note dies out at
the top right. Capture the note with  the net. Have Winkle use the bicycle pump
to pump up the saxophone player. Use Fingus to catch the mosquito coming out of
the sax  with the net.  With Fingus, use  the bicycle pump  to pump up  the sax
player. Use Winkle  to catch the note coming  out of the sax with  the net. Use
the mosquito on the headlight with Winkle to make the drummer play. When Fingus
catches the last note  with the net, you'll have the melody.  Use the melody on
the bottom left door. It will enter the  clock. Go see Tom and he will give you
the hourglass.

him jump on the mayonnaise. While Gromelon  is drenched, pick up the sword with
Winkle and activate him on Rustik. When Stalopicus' mouth is open, take the gum
with Fingus.  Use the gum  on the cupboard  lock to take  an imprint. Take  the
mayonnaise before leaving.

Problem:
What do I do with the imprint?

Hint:
Give the  dwarf blacksmith the  imprint, then the  sword. He will  ask for help
with the bellows. Use  the stool with Winkle on Otto to  make him grimace. When
he shakes his lance, hang Fingus on it. Fingus can then jump on the bellows and
the dwarf  blacksmith can forge the  key. Take the key  from the blacksmith and
use the  mayonnaise on Focus  with Winkle. While  the meat is  lowered, use the
stool with Fingus to take a piece. Take the anvil before leaving.

with Fingus before the hatchet drops  back. The monster's door will open. Enter
the  well  with  Fingus.  When  the  monster  starts  to  speak, go through the
monster's door  with Winkle. The  combination of the  monster's jaw moving  and
Winkle's voice will stun Schwarzy.

Problem:
Schwarzy.

Hint:
While Schwarzy is stunned, use the stool  on the hoist with Fingus to hitch him
to the  hoist. Use the false  teeth with Winkle to  scare Schwarzy, who'll hang
for a moment. Throw  the anvil at Schwarzy before he comes  up. He will go down
farther to lift the  cover off the well. Each goblin will  use a diving suit to
go down into the well.

Hint:
To get to the cornice, use the stool with Winkle and climb using his hands with
Fingus. Press the  switch with Fingus and make Winkle  go through the door that
opens in the bottom right eye. Winkle will  join Fingus at the top. To take the
crown,  walk Winkle  into the  ear  and  activate the  tongue immediately  with
Fingus. Make a cockroach come out, by sending Fingus into the ear. Activate the
tongue immediately with Winkle.

apples for  the Buffoon from  Kael, the  tree.  You need to  obtain a container
first though. Go through the hole with  Winkle to get to the Buffoon. He reacts
violently and a bean drops. Click on the stone and a mole appears. Use the bean
on the mole with Winkle. While they  struggle, take the mole's cap with Fingus.
Use the match on  the apples with Winkle. While the apple  is bouncing, use the
cap on it with Fingus. Use the apple on  the hole with Winkle to give it to the
Buffoon. He  comes down and rushes  to the mushrooms. In  turn, the two goblins
eat the mushrooms.

the catapult. Activate the bottom flagstone  with Fingus. Make Winkle go up and
activate  the  top  flagstone  after  placing  Fingus  on  the flagstone at the
rainbow's end. If necessary, Fingus can be  returned to the bowling pin side of
the room by  using the catapult. Put him  on the catapult and have  Winkle jump
from the star on the left onto the catapult. Activate the switch with Winkle to
make the  Buffoon fall. In  the short  time  he's in the  bubble makers circle,
quickly use Fingus on the feeler to  enclose him in a bubble. Make Winkle burst
the bubble with the pin to free the Buffoon.

Problem:

operation to put the stone on the 3rd  level. Place a goblin on the lion. Throw
the stone from level  3 with the other goblin. When the  first goblin is on the
giant's right shoulder make him act on the red head, which falls off. Come down
and take  the stone to level  2. Place Winkle on  the lion and throw  the stone
from level 2  with Fingus. Winkle will be placed  on the giant's left shoulder.
Go through  the shoulder hole  and bring  him  near the fallen  red head. Place
Fingus on the lion  and activate the head with Winkle. Fingus  will land on the
levitating rock.

Problem:
The Levitating Rock.

Hint:
As Fingus lands on the levitating rock, move him to the rock's "!!!" zone. When
he starts jumping, the rock will descend. When the rock gets to Winkle's level,
make him jump on it. The rock will  rise. Use Winkle on the small rock near the
bird  cage. Quickly  make Fingus  walk on  him. Use  the file  on the cage with
Fingus and get back the key.

Problem:

Problem:
The Lab.

Hint:
Use water  on the Buffoon.  An evil creature  will take him  to the Kingdom  of
Gloom  and  Doom.  Have  Winkle  take  the  pencil  and  use  it 3 times on the
blackboard.  Take the  sponge which  the furious  magician throws  at him. Have
Fingus use the  pencil on the magician's portrait. While  he's being hit by the
boomerang, jump on the armchair with Winkle  to catch it in flight. Make Winkle
use the mug on the magician who will bang on the table. He'll knock a toothpick
to the  other side of  the room.  While  the toothpick is  still bouncing, make
Fingus throw the boomerang.

Problem:
What do I do with the Toothpick?

Hint:
Have Winkle use  the toothpick on the skeleton  to open the rib cage.  A bottle
will smash on the ground leaving a  puddle. Use the sponge on the puddle. While
Winkle acts on the  pipe, use the wet sponge on the  smoke with Fingus. The way
to the Kingdom of Gloom and Doom opens. Send the gobliins through.

Problem:
The Kingdom of Doom and Gloom.

Hint:
Place Fingus  on the bottom  right eye, and  Winkle on the  left edge (with the
"!!!" marks)  of the top  right platform. Winkle  will jump and  Fingus will be
thrown. Pick  up the mouse  and use it  on the mud.  Jump on the  crocodile. As
Amoniak reaches to catch the goblin, use the boomerang with the other goblin on
the teeth.  This will cause  the Buffoon to  fall. Before the  little demon can
send the Buffoon back  to Amoniak, make a goblin jump from  the left edge (with
the "!!!" marks)  of the top right platform.  The eye will pop out  and hit the
little demon.

Problem:
The Buffoon and the Sponge.

Hint:
Put the sponge on  the rock. Place the Buffoon on the  eye and make Winkle jump
from  the left  edge (with  the "!!!"  marks) of  the top  right platform. This
throws the Buffoon onto the sponge which wets the rock. As the water flows, use
the pencil with Fingus  on the rock. He draws a magic  door which lasts a short
time. Make  Winkle turn the  handle. The three  heroes go out  the door and you
have won the game!
