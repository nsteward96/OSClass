     Begin  the  game by going into Dallben's cottage.   Get  the  
gruel  to feed HenWen.   The cupboard has supplies you will  need  
for your adventure, which can be obtained either now or after you  
feed  the pig.   Go to the barnyard and feed the pig.   There  is  
dried corn in the shed which the pig will eat,  as well, and also  
earns points -- your choice.   I could find no other use for  the  
corn or the gruel.  Then follow the pig back to the cottage where  
you will witness her vision.  Dallben will give you rope, and the  
adventure begins.  Be sure to fill your flask with water. 
 
     Go north for 3 screens,  avoiding water. (If you go into the  
water,  the pig gets scared, won't follow you, and you lose her.)   
Go  left  when you see the edge of the bramble patch.   When  you  
wiggle  through  the  brambles correctly,  you  find  the  hidden  
cottage  of  the  Fair Folk and HenWen  is  safe.   There's  some  
cookies in the cupboard. 
 
     Somewhere  along here you'll meet Gurgi.   When he asks  for  
something to eat, offer him either the cookies or the apple. 
 
    Go south upon leaving the cottage for 2 screens.  There is a  
lute  in  the tree with a hole in it.   Take it.   Go east for  2  
screens,  then  north,  which brings you to the  waterfall.   The  
magic  word  will cause a rock to lower in the water so  you  can  
walk on it.   Be careful -- if you fall in the water,  you drown.   
You'll  fall  in  a hole after entering  the  cave.   Offer  King  
Eidelleg  the lute and he'll give you a magic mirror  and  flying  
dust.   After  leaving  the cave,  go west for 3 screens til  you  
reach  the  swamp to the west,  then north for  2  screens  where  
you'll  see a dagger.   I've not found a use for the dagger  that  
earns points, but I take it anyway.  Go west to the scarey trees,  
then  north  to the rocks.   I wouldn't tell you how to  maneuver  
through the rocks,  even if I could explain it -- that would ruin  
some  of  your  fun.   But I will tell you  that  my  6-year  old  
daughter figured it out when I couldn't.  You must go through the  
rocks to get to the castle. 
 
     Upon  reaching  the point of the highest  rock,  throw  your  
rope.   It will go either east or west; it makes no matter which.   
Climb  the ledge and you will be facing the castle.   Welcome  to  
disk 2. 
 
     Walk  the  maze,   then  go  west  when  you're  facing  the  
alligators.   There  will  be  a henchman pulling a cart  at  the  
drawbrdige.   If he's not there the first time,  leave the screen  
and  return -- as many times as it takes.   Jump on the cart  and  
you're  in the castle.   Wait til the henchman leaves before  you  
get off the cart.   Go through the northern doorway into the wine  
cellar.   Go between the last 2 barrels on the right,  and you'll  
fall  into a sub-dungeon and find the princess.   Go east  for  2  
screens.   Look at the north wall.   There's a crack between some  
of the stones which are moveable and reveal a King's burial tomb.   
There is the magic sword.   The princess makes her  escape.   You  
leave the chamber and go south, then east til you see a gargoyle.   
Turn  his head and a door above you opens.   Have the sword ready  
so  you  can  bonk the  henchman.   He's  quite  a  pest.   After  
emerging,  go  north  again and get the keys on the wall to  your  
right.   Open  the  door straight ahead of you and  free  Fleuder  
Flam.   You  can either use the recently acquired keys or  simply  
untie his ropes. 
 
     Have your sword ready to bonk the henchman as you leave that  
room.   Go west through the first door immediately after  leaving  
the room,  then up the stairs.   Then go east to the main hallway  
and  south  back  through  the wine  cellar.   Go  south  to  the  
drawbridge  door and break the chain with the sword.   You'll  be  
bonking the henchman all along the way. 
 
     Return  to  disk 1 the same way  you  came.   After  getting  
through the rocks,  go south for 2 screens where you'll reach the  
southwest  portion of the swamp.   Use your flying dust to get to  
the  witch's  house.   Go inside and open the  chest.   When  the  
witches  appear,  offer them the sword and you'll go outside  and  
receive the cauldron.  The gwythaint will take the cauldron while  
the witches are talking to you. 
 
     Go back to the castle.   Take the same route as before, when  
you  found the princess.   Go south for one screen,  then through  
the east doorway (where the skeletons are).  Use the magic mirror  
at the proper time and the King jumps in the cauldron.  You float  
on  a log down the river to the cauldron and the witches  appear.   
They  will offer you 3 things in exchange for the  cauldron.   Do  
nothing  til they offer you the third item  -- the  sword.   This  
wins the game with 230 out of 230 points.
