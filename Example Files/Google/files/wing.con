[EDITOR: The scene: Several members are in the CONference room and awaiting the
arrival of tonights guest.  Some friendly bantering going on.]

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Don, Have you been using Wing Commander?

(Don R.) Seen it a little, yes. Actually I sell it, that's why I'm here.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Oh Really?  Is it selling?

(Don R.) Yes, very well. It's one of my top selling progs. I expect the Secret
Mission disk in 2 weeks, right?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Riiiiiiight.

(The Sierra Pest!) Is this the room for the Chris Roberts CON?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Yes, Chris Roberts will join us tonight at 10 PM.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Don, How many copies do you sell a week (or a day?)? Just
curious.

(Don R.) Maybe 2 to 4 copies a day, that's pretty good, althouh Kings Quest 5
is selling at about 6 a day, and some of my Genesis titles sell as many as 50 a
day.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Don, Yes it is good. Where is your store?

(Don R.) NY  Electronics Boutique

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Welcome everyone that's just tuned in!  We're expecting
Chris Roberts any time now.

(The Sierra Pest!) Hope he didn't get hit by a Kilrathi on the way :)

(Don R.) haha

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) WELCOME Mr. ROBERTS!!!!!

(Don R.) Welcome Chris.

(The Sierra Pest!) Hi Chris!

(Tsunami) Hi Chris!

(Jon Oakes) I think Drakhheth mu.. CHRIS IS HERE??!

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) Just testing you all <g> Cruel huh?

[EDITOR: RoboCop is always good for a little controversy. This time he's played
a little hoax on us.]

(Jon Oakes) Hi Chri...uh, Robocop, Shame, Shame, Shame!

(Tsunami) Robo,  That was terrible! <g>

(Mike "Maj. Relayer") Full Guns on him!

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) I'm bullet-proof Mike!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Hehe. Robo is an evil one. He had me looking over _my_
shoulder!

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) Anxious bunch here tonite Jeff!

(Jon Oakes) Your mother looks like Drakkheth!!!!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Welcome everyone that just got in!  We're expecting Chris
Roberts any minute now. Here he is now.

(Origin Systems) Yes indeed!

(Tsunami) Hi Chris!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Welcome!

(The Sierra Pest!) Hi Chris!

(Don R.) 'lo chris

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) I see him!! Welcome Chris!

(Jon Oakes) YO! Mega Game designer stud!

(Origin Systems) Hi folks!

(The Sierra Pest!) <Standing on seat to see over crowd>

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Are you ready Chris?

(Origin Systems) Not really, but think we can "wing" it.

(Tsunami/Ass't SysOp) <groan>

(Don R.) boooooo!!!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Okay, Here we go.  Tonights CONference will be run under
PROCEDURES AND ETIQUETTE FOR FORMAL CONFERENCES. Sometimes our meetings are
strictly informal, there are no special rules, and participants generally talk
when they please.  However, for more formal meetings, some rules must be
established to keep the CON running smoothly and give all a chance to
participate.  Please wait for your turn to speak.  This CON will be held in
three parts: To start off, our guest speaker will make some opening remarks or
comments.  During this time, all CON attendees must remain quiet.  When the
guest is finished, I will ask for a show of hands of people who wish to ask a
question.  The HOST will then invite you, in order, to ask one question and one
follow up question.  After one pass thru the question queue, I will ask for
another round of questions.  After a couple of rounds of questions we'll throw
the CONnference open for a free-for-all to finish up. Thanks for your attention
to that awful but necessary stuff.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Tonights guest is Chris Roberts the Designer, Director,
Co-Producer, and Co-Engineer for the megahit 3-D Space Combat Simulator, Wing
Commander.  Chris, first of all, thank you very much for taking the time to be
with us tonight here in GAMERS!  Also congratulations!  We've all been having a
great time with WC, and it's been our *HOT* Topic for the past month.  Do you
want to make some opening remarks? <OVER>

(Origin Systems) Sure give me a moment to compose... While I'm doing that let
me introduce you all to Greg Malone who is handling the keyboard tonight.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Hello and Welcome to Greg Malone AND Chris Roberts!

(Origin Systems) So, anyway.  To answer your question, I was out to achieve the
goal of creating the feel of a movie in a computer game.  In attempting to do
so, I also wanted the player to associate closely with the lead character so
the player would feel like he was the star of the movie (game).  Seems we
accomplished that to some degree.  One more thing With Wing Commander 2, I want
to put even further emphasis on the story and characters now that we know what
works and now that we've got the basic system down.  Of course, I know we'll
talk more about WC2 here in a few.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Thanks very much. Boy you really started some mouths
watering already!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) We'll start tonight off with a question from Jon Oakes.
Jon, you have the floor for one question and a follow up.

(Jon Oakes) First off. Thanks Chris for a FANTASTIC GAME!  But I'm dying of
anticipation. When will The Secret Missions Disk be sent out?

(Origin Systems) Glad you asked! We actually signed off on the Secret Missions
today (yeah!) which means that they will be shipping by the end of the week.
That means all those who have ordered it direct from Origin will get theirs
quickly and retail stores will get theirs a week or so later, though retail
will be selling the Secret Missions for $29.95 as opposed to the $19.95 for
direct. 

(Jon Oakes) Can you give me any teasers as to what the plot will be like for
the Secret Missions?? I've heard about THE KITTIES SECRET WEAPON and such. Any
tidbits?

(Origin Systems) You've actually got the gist of it. Yes, there has been a
distress call from the Goddard Colony in the Deneb sector, and there is indeed
evidence of a new Kilrathi weapon! The Tiger's Claw is dispatched on a daring
secret mission to penetrate behind Kilrathi lines and destroy the new weapon.

(Mike "Maj. Relayer") Chris, Is it true that some missions get easier after you
try them a few times?

(Origin Systems) No, it may *seem* that way, but you're just getting better.

(Mike "Maj. Relayer") Can all of the new WC2's features be accessed on a 286
machine?

(Origin Systems) Yes, but if you don't have expanded memory you won't get the
camera replay or the digitized voices (referring to WC2, *not* Secret Missions,
of course).

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) I have a couple of questions. First, will there be
tail-gunners in WC2?

(Origin Systems) Yes, one of the ships you will fly is a Broadsword bomber, and
it will have two gunnery positions.  This will prove helpful on some of the
specially designed bombing runs that will be integral to killing capital ships.

(RoboCop/Sierra Pro!) NEAT!!! You've been at Origin for about 1 1/2 years. Now
that games are jumping into a VGA standard, have you considered working for
other companies with more VGA related programming tech. like Accolade, Access,
Sierra, Etc.?  (I appologize, I hope that didn't sound like I was saying Origin
didn't do well with VGA.)

(Origin Systems) I've actually been with Origin for 3 years. And I'd rather
push the VGA standard with Origin because we TOO are trying to set new
standards in graphics technology.  You're witnessing the first fruits of this
and we are actually working on stuff that even blows Wing Commander away! (g)

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Thanks Robocop. Now the next question goes to The Sierra
Pest! Take it away PEST!

(The Sierra Pest!) Will there be a CD-ROM Version of WC2?

(Origin Systems) We're certainly are looking into it.  WC2 *may* make it onto
CD ROM, but by late 91 and into 92, we'll definitely be there.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Thanks Sierra Pest. Next question is from Brian Esch. Go
ahead Brian!

(BRIAN ESCH) Thank you for many *hours* of entertainment. We were disappointed
in the memory problems.  When is wc2 to be relesaed. thank you for an
excellent game!

(Origin Systems) I'm glad you've had a good time. Sorry about any memory
inconveniences or problems, but when you write a game that pushes the PC to and
beyond its limits you run the risk of problems such as these. There are so many
hardware variations out there.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next we go to Eric Anderson. Go ahead Eric.

(eric H. anderson) Chris, Just a couple questions.  First, does WC have Disk
Caching built in?

(Origin Systems) Yes. If you have the expanded memory, WC uses that to cache
graphics.

(eric H. anderson) Thats what I figured. Do some of the messages that the other
pilots give you get out of sequence or is it my imagination?

(Origin Systems) Not that I know of.  The wingmen will act on their own
initiative sometimes which might give you the impression they've spoken out of
turn.

(eric H. anderson) Not what I meant. What I mean is the gossip they give you in
the bar.  It seems out of sequence at times.

(Origin Systems) Still, no, it shouldn't be out of sequence.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next up is Fabian Gonell, you're on Fabian!

(Fabian Gonell) Good evening. Have you considered a sequel to WC or WC2. With
the player on the side of the Kilrathi?

(Origin Systems) We've considered such a scenario, although for WC2 you will
still be fighting for the Confederation. But, you may be interested to know
that in WC2 the situation does occur where one Kilrathi colony rebels against
the Kilrathi Empire and it requests human assistance and the rebels send their
fighters to fight *alongside* you against the Empire.

(Fabian Gonell) Any chance of multi-player WC thruogh modem connections?

(Origin Systems) Yes, we are considering it as an add-on disk to possibly WC2.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Outstanding answer! Okay the floor goes to Quinne Bass, Go
ahead and ask Quinne!

(QUINNE BASS) First of all, congratulations on the GOOD GAME. When will all
these goodies for WC2 be available?

(Origin Systems) Fall 91 is the plan. Correction, WC2 will be available in late
Spring. Any add-on disks will probably follow in the Fall.

(QUINNE BASS) Will ther be a scenario in which someone from the federation
turns... dare I use the word "traitor"???

(Origin Systems) Okay, who have you been talking to????

(QUINNE BASS) Just a <wicked> guess. That's what u get when u play 23 hrs with
no sleep.

(Origin Systems) Actually, that IS one of the pivotal plot elements in WC2.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Too close to the bone there Quinne.  I guess we better
move along to Eric Schiffli, You're on Eric S.

(Eric Schiffli) Has the reported problem with the joysticks been resolved?

(Origin Systems) Sorry for any joystick problems out there.  In WC, I wanted
the program to be able to auto-detect and center all joysticks. Unfortunately,
due to the million hardware configurations we missed a couple, but have made
fixes for them. 

(Eric Schiffli) Also, I hope you haven't finished the setup for WC2 because I
think being able to pick your own ships after a certain time would be a nice
perk before you retire. Even Captain Kirk can fly what he pleases.  Perhaps
this could be on a follow-up disk? Maybe also armament options,too.

(Origin Systems) Good questions.  Since you are supposed to be in the military
you fly what you are assigned to, but in WC2 you will be given different
weapons payloads for specific missions. I'll give your suggestion some more
thought, thanks.  Perhaps we can do that on a follow up disk, such as the
Secret Missions disk gives you the added ability to select any of the original
40 missions to fly at will.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Thanks for the great questions AND answers! That finishes
the first round of questions.  Before we go ahead with the next round, I wanna
take a minute to say Congratulations to Tsunami a fellow GAMERS Staffer who's
moved UP the ladder to Assistant SysOp. This is the first CONference I've seen
Tsunami in since his 'promotion' so Tsunami, Congratulations, and you have the
floor to ask a question!

(eric H. anderson) Congrats, Tsunami

(BRIAN ESCH) good jog T!

(Tsunami/Ass't SysOp) Thanks.  First, I want to thank Chris and Greg for my
recent visit with Origin and the Spookhouse!  Chris, could you talk about some
of the game ideas you have for using the WING COMMANDER technology *other* than
in WING COMMANDER sequels?

(Origin Systems) The main project I'm working on for Fall 91 will have a
combination of WC graphics technology and 3D polygon (using shading and texture
mapping) to depict *terrain*.  This will give another dimension of realism to
the experience.

(Tsunami/Ass't SysOp) What kind of game will that be?  A ground vehicle
simulator?  Or something completely different?

(Origin Systems) Hmmmm, could be. But can't discuss details yet since we're
still working on the technology aspects and I believe the technology has to fit
the game. (ie. If it works well for a ground vehicle simulator, that's what
we'll do.)

(Tsunami/Ass't SysOp) Thanks!  Sorry I'm so nosey. 

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next question is from Jon Oakes. You're on Jon.

(Jon Oakes) Thanks. Chris, What does one have to do to "BE" a Chris Roberts?
(Besides have Mr. & Mrs. Roberts for parents.) I mean, what school and
experience do you have. In essence, how did you LEARN to do a game like WING
COMMANDER?

(Origin Systems) I've been in the computer game industry since 1982 (in the
U.K.).  I taught myself how to program and have always had a love for films and
computer games.  Besides all this you need a clear vision of the game you're
trying to create. And you've gotta stick with that vision and not compromise
it.

(Jon Oakes) You said you plan to emphasize the characters and plot in WC2.
Does that mean that you'll get in trouble for blowing up your Wingman?  I
thought that was the most inconsistent thing in an otherwise great game!

(Origin Systems) Yes, definitely. Unless its Maniac, of course (grin). 

(Jon Oakes) Ya! Nuke Maniac!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next comes Eric Schiffli, Take it away Eric.

(Eric Schiffli) I think I've found a strange bug. I went out on the run where
you have to make a recon of a cat ship. My winggman was killed, and when I was
debriefed he reappeared just long enough to help then went back to his coffin.
What's up?

(Origin Systems) Are you sure he died, and didn't just break off and go home? 

(Eric Schiffli) He died. I may have killed him myself! (I get out of hand
sometimes). I remember the funeral after the mission.

(Origin Systems) I don't know of any such situation.

(Eric Schiffli) Speaking of getting out of hand, is there any way to destroy
the Tiger Claw yourself?

(Origin Systems) Yes, point your guns at it and shoot for a long time.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Whew! Okay Brian Esch, Let loose with another blast!

(BRIAN ESCH) Can you use the combined victories of WC1 in WC2? 

(Origin Systems) In WC2, you will transfer over your WC character (including
his Secret Missions data) but, due to circumstances beyond your control you
will be disgraced, cashiered, and demoted to the equivalent of Coast Guard at
the start of the game <the plot thickens> <g>.

(BRIAN ESCH) Chris, thanks again for an inspired game.  How are the joystick
fixes available?

(Origin Systems) If you think you have a joystick problem call Origin Customer
Service at 512-328-0282.  There is a software fix available for some.  (Also
you can communicate via CompuServe).

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next up is Mike Barrs, Take it Mike!

(Mike Barrs) Do you research a game like WC, read sci-fi, watch movies or just
think it up from scratch?

(Origin Systems) Good question Mike. I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of
books, and play a lot of games. And I put a lot of serious research into flight
dynamics to make sure the flight sim seemed right.

(Mike Barrs) You did great, thanks!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Next up is Thomas Rice. Go on Thomas.

(Thomas Rice) I have a 286 AST Premium and I cannot load WC at all ;(  .?!?

(Origin Systems) Sorry about the problem with the 286 AST. I don't wanna brush
you off, but call Customer Service for a fix.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Chris can't do much about that here and now Thomas. You
should call their customer support. But at the same time I would mention that I
haven't gotten an answer to my customer support question over on GAMPUB Forum
for at least five days.

(Thomas Rice) Ok, Thanks.

(eric H. anderson) Chris, great game. In your opinion which is the better sound
board, AdLib or Sound Blaster?

(Origin Systems) Sound Blaster is better since it also offers digitized voices
which we are going to be using in the future.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) I'll jump in line to take a turn with a question.  Are you
considering making the choice of picture for a pilot user selectable, maybe
even offer a woman pilot?  over

(Origin Systems) Yes, but the problem with that is that your character will
appear in many scenes and will need multiple graphics files to accomodate the
variation of characters.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) One more, what's been your best selling game?

(Origin Systems) THIS ONE!  <G> 

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) One or two more questions, then we wrap this up.  Thanks
for staying so long guys!

(BRIAN ESCH) Is there a problem with sound degradationas as the game
progresses?  I have a Sound Blaster and 2 meg.

(Origin Systems) I don't think so, are you experiencing it regularly?  

(BRIAN ESCH) Yes.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Brian, take it up with customer service. They can help the
most. Jon, A last question from you?

(Origin Systems) Good answer. Thanks Brian.

(Jon Oakes) Any chance of a mission construction set? And also how do I apply
to be a beta tester for WC2? 

(Origin Systems) Another possible add-on disk for WC2. Secondly, if you live in
Austin Texas you might be able to get a job as a beta tester.

(Jon Oakes) Heh, maybe I'll commute from California!

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) So you don't use any outside testers?

(Origin Systems) No, not usually.  We have a large QA staff for testing (15
people).

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) It seems like it. We haven't had any widespread problems
other than joystick stuff. Hmmm, lets see... Who's idea is the orchestra at the
startup? And can you say something about Origin FX which you worked on?

(Origin Systems) I guess I'm responsible for the Origin FX and orchestra stuff.
Origin FX is our new core graphics and sound system that will be driving our
new releases in the future.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Very neat touch. I like the orchestra bit.  I have a Sound
Blaster, will the people really talk if I have enough expanded memory, like
500k?  I see their lips move very realistically. 

(Origin Systems) Yes, in WC2 the speech will be used during flight simulation
only due to lack of disk space, but on the CD ROM version the characters will
speak everywhere in the game.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) How do you 'research flight dynamics'?

(Origin Systems) Well 4 years of physics in the UK and a high interest in WW 1
and 2 air combat, plus flying radio controlled aircraft. 

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Is message speed 1 the fastest and 5 the slowest? 

(Origin Systems) Yes.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Thanks very much! I hereby declare the formal CONference
over! Thanks VERY VERY much Greg Malone and Chris Roberts for making this a
fabulously successful CONference!  I invite everyone to stick around for a
minute or two of informal chatter.

<LIGHTS COMING UP>

<CURTAIN COMING DOWN>

(Origin Systems) Thanks for having us.  Enjoyed it!  Scorch the furballs!  OVER
AND OUT! 

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) What a hoppin' CON!  I haven't been in one like that in a
long time!  I still have four or five good questions!

(Tsunami/Ass't SysOp) I gotta run too!  Great job Jeff!  Good questions all!

(Jon Oakes) That was definitely a classic.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Great member participation. See you all around.

[EDITOR: As the CON winds down, most of the attendees have left the room now.]

(BRIAN ESCH) Origin has not been forthcoming in its forum support, has it?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Yes, I think that's their reputation.  I'm sorry we
couldn't hit them on that point either.

(BRIAN ESCH) Really.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) But it's not Chris' fault that the product isn't
supported.  I have had a question in to them for days and no answer.  But they
did just switch CIS reps only a few weeks ago.

(BRIAN ESCH) Did you succeed in WC?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Not yet.

(BRIAN ESCH) How far did you get?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) I'm hung up on a mission where I have to save a Ralari
from being blown up.

(BRIAN ESCH) You can't win that one. Just move on.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) I just might, but the next one's no peach either. I'm not
enjoying it as much now as I was earlier because of the difficult missions.
Also I have worked a long time trying to get the dang expanded memory thing to
work with my hardware.

(BRIAN ESCH) I know, move on anyway.  Jeff, you should have held Origin
accountable for the hardware stuff, pal.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Lets blast them later. I'll join in. But, realize Chris is
just a designer, and customer support is a different ballpark.

(BRIAN ESCH) Gothcha. Then why did he sign on as Origin?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Because it's Origins CIS account he was using, and he does
work for them.  But he's a designer/director, not customer support liason.  I
am with you, I want answers for my problems too. But reaming Chris wasn't gonna
get us anywhere.  We got a telephone number from him. Maybe we should hit that.

(BRIAN ESCH) I have certain answers.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Go ahead.

(BRIAN ESCH) I called their support line. It helped. Like your memory for
instance what are files and buffers set at?

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) I have tried both defaults (none specified) and 25.

(BRIAN ESCH) That won't work. Try setting files=5 and buffers=5 makes a *big*
diff.

(Jeff Horrocks/HOST) Will do. Will try it right now. I should dash off. Great
chatting with you. Thanks for coming!
