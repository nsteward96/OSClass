         The absolute best resource file for nethack just got better!
        --------------------------------------------------------------

                                 PRESENTING:

                             The Nethack Spoilers
                                Revision 7.00
                        Copyright 1991, Paul Waterman

This file contains revision 7.00 of the WCST Spoilers.  Revision 7.00
incorporates more changes than any previous release of the spoiler files.
Many new sections have been added, and the entire file has been re-arranged
for maximum usefulness.  In addition, extensive formatting changes have been
done in order to make the tables and text as readable as possible.
Essentially, the entire file has been revised.

For revision 7.00, we will be trying something unique.  We will be releasing
the spoiler files in ASCII format on rec.games.hack and comp.sources.games
(and we have an ongoing commitment to continue doing so in future releases).
However, in addition, we will be offering a laser printed version of the
spoilers for sale.

The commercial version is beautifully formatted on a desktop publishing
system, and includes "extras" that the public release doesn't have such as
page numbers, a table of contents, a complete index, and eye-pleasing
graphics.  The entire 100+ pages is spiral bound with durable covers for
those late night hacking sessions.  Additionally, the commercial version
includes a useful command summary sheet and several "cheat sheets."  One of
these cheat sheets has a complete summary of all objects available within the
game, and there are also cheat sheets for each object type, which include
complete price lists, check-off lists, and identifying information.

This commercial version is available for $13, plus $2.00 postage and
handling.  Also, quantity discounts are available with as few as five copies,
so get together with some fellow nethackers from your site and take advantage
of the lowest price you can get.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:

Once upon a time, there was a game called hack.  Hack was a pretty good game,
and a lot of people really enjoyed playing it.  Then a strange and wonderful
creature called "The Dev Team" got hold of it, and hack was never the same
again.  For starters, it suddenly got a name change, and was called nethack.
But the biggest change was in the game itself.  No longer was it a fun
afternoon show to watch in black and white on a nine inch set.  It suddenly
became a three dimensional color holovision show with dolby surround sound
and much, much more.  (Our thanks to the dev team for a job well done.)

The problem with this is that people started getting addicted to the action,
the adventure, their character getting killed over and over again...  In
order to prevent the untimely demise of characters whose rated lifespan was
about double the actual lifespan, a bunch of people came together and began
giving each other hints about how to dodge that nasty shopkeeper, and how to
get rid of that awful wizard, and this worked well... for a time.

There was still a problem with this, though, for once the suggestion was
given, unless carefully hoarded away, it was gone forever, and there were
always new people who hadn't heard the suggestions.  Thus, the nethack
spoiler file was created.

Within this file is a large collection of lore about the game of nethack.
Some of it may not be true, but we have made the best effort possible to
verify all of the information contained herein.  Much of it has been
verified, corrected, or added since the original posting of revision one on
the net.

Also, we would like to request that any corrections, modifications,
suggestions, etc. be e-mailed directly to nhspoil@wheaton.UUCP and not posted
to the net.  We will attempt to verify any information sent us and then we
will both add it to the spoiler file (for the next release) and post an
official correction/addition to rec.games.hack.

Note:  Please do not send e-mail to us asking for a copy of the spoilers or
for a copy of nethack itself (or the source code, etc.).  We do not honor
these requests, and often just ignore them.

Be warned:  If you use the knowledge contained herein, your game will never
be the same.  Your horizons will suddenly be expanded, but you may end up
thinking that the game is less than it once was.  That is the risk you must
take if you choose to read this file.

Good luck, and happy hacking!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision Numbers:

In order to keep a decent idea of how the spoiler file is progressing, we
have set up an official policy on how Revision Numbers will change.  Any
minor revisions corrections or amplifications will advance the revision
number by .01. New sections added (such as this one), or complete re-writes
of existing sections will advance the revision number by .10.  Any complete
rewrite of the entire file (just in case - it might actually happen) will
advance the revision number to the next integer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits:

Well, this should actually be a very large list.  Among others, it should
include almost everyone who has posted any hints of value to the net within
about the last year (or even longer in some cases).  Some people who have
made contributions to the cause of these spoilers above and beyond the call
of duty, however, are listed here:

     Kenneth Arromdee
     Bill de Beaubien
     Alan Edwards
     Walter Fergusson
     David Goldfarb
     Laurence Gordon
     Kate Gregory
     Dolf Grunbauer
     David Hairston
     Michael Heggen
     Douglas Henke
     Greg Hudson
     Lucas B. Kruijswijk
     Alan Light
     Stephen Marino
     Andrew Pearce
     Robert Potter
     Ken Roth
     Brajesh K. Singh
     C. G. J. Thompson, et.al
     David Throop
     Steve Warren
     Laura C. Waterman
     Dominik Zemmler

If any of the rest of you out there know you contributed something to the
cause, but don't see your name listed here - don't get us wrong.  It's not
that we're ungrateful!  We probably just nuked your name by mistake!

Note:  All names are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and not by
order of importance of contribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using The Spoilers:

There's really not much to say on this subject, other than a few intuitive
pointers.  How you use the spoilers is simple:  You read them, and apply the
knowledge contained within to your game of nethack.

Those of you who are using the commercial version of the spoilers will have a
complete index at your disposal, which should aid greatly in looking up just
about anything you'd like to know about.  For those of you who are using the
public version, however, we do have one major hint for getting at what you
want within the file quickly.

The section titles tend to be fairly unique, and are always followed by a
colon.  This should make it very simple to get to whatever section you want
quickly.  Just load the file into your editor (or if you're on a unix system,
even use 'more' for that matter), and use the search function to look for the
section.  For instance, from within more or vi, use the slash key ("/") and
what you'd like to search for ("Armor:" for example).

This technique is also very useful for finding every reference to a
particular topic.  If you'd like to know about wishing for instance, just
search for every occurance of the word "wish" in the file.

          |            Commonalities and Generalities              |
          ----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Questions:

Q: I've made it to the first level of hell (probably by falling through a
     trap in the castle level), but I can't find any down staircases?  How
     can I get down farther?
A: You'll find that if you're confused and read a scroll of teleportation
     you'll get teleported to a different level.  Cursed scrolls of
     teleportation and level teleporters also do this.  If you have teleport
     control (via a ring or intrinsic), you can choose what level to teleport
     to.  Teleport down to about level fifty and then work your way up.

Q: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up through the levels of Hell, but
     I'm stuck.  I'm in a relatively small area in the middle of the level, I
     can't find a way out, and there's no stairway up - only one going back
     down.
A: Sounds like you've found Vlad's Tower.  Try going back down two levels and
     exiting from the base of the tower.  Then try looking in the upper left
     hand corner of the maze for another stairway going up.  The tower levels
     always have an up staircase placed there.  See the section on SPECIAL
     LEVELS for more information.

Q: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up, but the Wizard keeps popping in
     and I'm tired of killing him.  Is there anything I can do to get him off
     of my case?
A: Most things you can do won't stop him from coming after you again.  I saw
     a post once on rec.games.hack that had about thirty suggestions, but
     none of them would work.  Basically, the only way to stop him from
     coming after you is to exploit a "feature" of the game.  Wait near the
     up staircase for him.  Then, throw a potion of paralysis at him.  During
     the 1-15 turns that he will be paralyzed, go up the staircase.  He won't
     come after you any more. The reason for this is that the game only
     updates the paralysis counters for creatures on the same level as you -
     thus, it realizes that the Wizard is still around, but paralyzed, and it
     won't un-paralyze him unless you go back to that level.  (Incidentally,
     don't count on this working in the next version of nethack.)

Q: I'm in the endgame and I'm in a long hallway that runs north-south.  I
     can't seem to find a secret door, though, and I can't teleport.  How do
     I get to the other side of the level?
A: Be patient and keep searching.  There's a secret door in the upper left
     wall of the corridor.  However, there's a lot of nasty creatures in the
     center of the endgame level, so if you're willing to sacrifice the
     experience, and you can polymorph, it might be better to turn into a
     xorn and go around the center area.

Q: I've heard a lot about "named weapons," but I can't seem to get one.  How
     can I get one?
A: Well, there are five ways of getting named weapons, also known as
     artifacts.  The first, and perhaps most obvious one, is to wish for it.
     When you are asked what you want to wish for, type "a (blessed) (+n)
     [weapon type] named [name]," where blessed and +n (be sure to substitute
     a number for n!) are optional, and the weapon type is correct for that
     named weapon (see the ARTIFACTS section and WISHING section for more
     information).  Another way to get a named weapon is to have it given to
     you by your deity.  If you sacrifice (#offer) enough, eventually you
     will probably see an object appear at your feet.  This will be a named
     weapon.  A third way to get a named weapon is to find it.  Some of them
     will just be randomly generated (although very rare), so be on the
     lookout.  You will know it's named when you pick it up - it's not
     necessary to identify it.  You can also gain some of the named weapons
     by simply finding the appropriate weapon type and using the #name
     command.  Sting and Orcrist are notable in this regard.  Finally, you
     can get Excalibur by #dipping a normal longsword in a fountain (see
     FOUNTAIN EFFECTS for more details about this).

Q: I was playing a character and he/she got polymorphed into a new human.  I
     was asked to give the character a different name, and now I can't get
     the character back.  What do I do?
A: Nethack allows you to have multiple characters with different names, and
     whenever nethack saves a character it always uses the character's name,
     regardless of whether that character used to have a different name.  In
     order to access a character of a particular name (or start one with a
     different name), the easiest thing is to give nethack a -u flag and your
     name.  For instance, type "nethack -u name" where "name" is your
     character's name ("Endiel" in my case - and I'll send you updates to the
     spoilers if you can figure out where it came from).

Q: I was playing nethack when I hit the '!' key by mistake.  Now I'm sitting
     at my prompt, and I don't know what's happened to my game.  What gives?
A: In nethack, the '!' key will create a shell for you.  What this does is
     allow you to quickly pop out of nethack in order to do stuff, without
     messing up your nethack game.  On most systems, you can exit the shell
     and get back to your nethack game by typing "exit."

Q: I've found a hawaiian shirt lying around, and I've heard them mentioned in
     the spoilers.  What use are they?
A: Basically, Hawaiian shirts let you effectively drop your AC by several
     more points, as they can be worn under a suit of armor (the more pieces
     of armor, the better the possible AC).  When not enchanted, they don't
     do much good (and actually can do harm, as shopkeepers will try to cheat
     you if they see it).  But if it's enchanted and under a suit of armor or
     cloak (where the shopkeeper can't see it), it can be quite useful.

Q: I've been punished, and I can't stand lugging around this ball and chain.
     What can I do to get rid of it?
A: There are several ways to accomplish this.  In the meantime, though,
     unless you have a pretty good weapon, pick up the iron ball and wield
     it.  To get it off, try reading a scroll (or casting a spell) of remove
     curse.  Or, try feeding it to a rust monster, rock mole, or iron golem.
     A nymph may steal it.  Or, you can polymorph into a rust monster, rock
     mole, or iron golem, and eat it yourself.  Finally, you can polymorph
     into a nymph and remove it.  Note that lock-picks and keys won't work to
     get it off.

Q: I've come up with some cool ideas for additions/modifications to nethack.
     What should I do with them?
A: You should send your ideas (also bugs) to nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.
     Don't expect to receive back a confirmation that they received it - the
     nethack-bugs account receives a lot of mail.

Q: I'm interested in making some modifications to nethack (or already have
     done so), and think they would make a cool addition to the game.  I'd
     like to make these modifications/additions public.  What should I do?
A: Once again, send some e-mail to nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.  Here's
     some hints as to what all you should send:  1) If you have already made
     the modifications, make sure it is well documented with comments, and
     then send the changes (*not* the whole source code) to the Dev Team (at
     nethack-bugs...).  2) Send a description of the planned (or finished)
     code changes and how this affects other sections of the code.  3)
     Include a description of how you think the idea will impact the game,
     and why you think your idea is good or necessary.  4) Be prepared for a
     rejection on grounds that appear totally arbitrary to you.  If you do,
     consider the reasons given and think about re-working your ideas and
     repeating the process.  5) If you really think your ideas are worthwhile
     but the Dev Team refuses to agree (possible, but unlikely), consider
     distributing them as optional add-ons through net newsgroups such as
     rec.games.hack and comp.sources.games.

Q: I have these spoilers, but where can I get a copy of nethack from?
A: Please don't send e-mail to us!  We're not in the habit of sending out
     copies of nethack, and rarely reply to messages asking where to get it
     from.  Information is posted on a regular basis on rec.games.hack about
     where to get the latest version of nethack.

Q: I was playing nethack via modem from my personal computer when I lost the
     connection.  I dialed back into the system immediately, and my login was
     sitting there idle, still playing nethack.  What should I do to get it
     to save out?
A: This problem tends to happen only on unix systems.  If you're non-
     technical, and don't know much about unix, you should contact the games
     administrator, system administrator, or any person with superuser
     priveleges and ask them to "please send a hangup signal to my nethack
     process."  If you know a little more, you might want to try doing this
     yourself.  First of all, find the process ID (PID) of the nethack
     process.  This can be accomplished with the 'ps' command (see your
     manual for more information about the ps command).  Next, use the 'kill'
     command to send a 'HUP' (hangup) to the process (again, see your manual
     for more information about the kill command).  Don't send a 'KILL'
     signal, as this will cause the game to die instantly and not save.
     Sending a 'HUP' should cause the program to exit, saving your game, and
     you should then be able to load it in again normally.  If the computer
     won't allow you to kill the process, your nethack game is probably
     running with special priveleges, and you'll need to contact the games
     administrator, system administrator, or a superuser in order to send it
     a hangup signal.

General Hints:

Lizard corpses, like food rations, won't ever spoil.
It is a great idea to give like-aligned priests 400*your level in gold.
If you attack a rival priest in his temple, his god will fight for him, so
     make it your temple first (i.e. convert the altar).
A guaranteed way to change your alignment is to kill a unicorn of your
     alignment and offer the fresh corpse at an altar of the god whose
     alignment you wish to convert to.
Friendly monsters may become tame if you give them the right food (try
     tripe).
Zombie and mummy corpses are already old corpses, so can't be sacrificed
     (however, they can be eaten before they spoil).
The bigger the sacrifice, the better the reward.
Eating a clove of garlic cures lycanthropy.  Prayer can too.
A ring of warning warns:  white, pink, red, ruby, purple, and run at black.
Kicking is great for killing monsters at low levels (especially for Samurais
     and Priests).
Don't kick in shop doors that are closed for inventory.
A wand of digging makes a quick way down (use '>' for the direction).
Fill trap doors with boulders.  You can also cross water this way.
When dipping in holy water, amber means uncursed, light blue means blessed.
Dipping a corpse in holy water will make it take longer to rot.
Dipping a dart may identify a potion of sickness (it poisons the dart).
To make a scroll blank and or holy/unholy water normal, zap a wand of
     cancellation at it.
To use a wand on yourself, use '.' for the direction.
Blessed magic lamps always give wishes if they have a charge.
When you run into a great number of statues, don't look out.
Zap monsters that engulf you with a wand of digging.
To find the mimics in a shop, walk in, then back out.
To create a scroll with a magic marker just write the name of the scroll on a
     blank scroll (i.e. "magic mapping").
If you are wearing dragon scale mail and get polymorphed, you will polymorph
     into the same type of dragon as your dragon scale mail.
Being magic resistant prevents teleport traps from working properly.
You cannot pick up items while levitating, therefore it is not always good to
     be levitating.  However, vampire lords levitate but can pick up objects.
If you want to stop levitating, just fly over a sink, and you will.
Mirrors may be used to scare some monsters.  They also, of course, kill
     Medusa.
If you cannot eat it now, tin it or freeze it.
You can wield a cockatrice corpse if you're wearing gloves, but don't go down
     stairs while carrying one, especially if you are overloaded.  They are
     wonderful for clearing out zoos, barracks, and throne rooms.
To determine whether an item is blessed, regular, or cursed, drop it on an
     altar.  If the glow is amber, it's blessed.  Black means cursed.
Dropping water or unholy water at a lawful altar will turn it into holy
     water.
Dropping water (holy or unholy) at a neutral altar will make it normal water.
Dropping water or holy water at a chaotic altar will make it unholy water.
A ring of levitation will protect you from a xan (they're real short).
It is possible to lose telepathy if you are not chaotic and you kill a
     peaceful human.
Gremlins can steal intrinsics from you.
It is possible to jump through an escaped trapdoor by hitting '>'.

          |                     The Character                      |
          ----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment:

Every character and monster in nethack has an alignment.  Even some objects
(specifically artifacts, or named weapons) have alignments.  Describing
exactly what alignment is and what it entails is tricky, however.  Expressed
simply, alignment is what side you've aligned yourself with - good, evil, or
neither.  What is considered "good" and "evil" in nethack is very much the
traditional medieval picture of good and evil.  Thus, a brief description of
the three alignments and the behavior expected from a character of that
alignment follows:

Chaotic:  A chaotic character has basically aligned him/herself with the side
of evil.  He/she likes doing things that would normally be considered "bad"
just for the joy of it.  Chaotics tend to have the attitude of "looking out
for number one."  A chaotic character will probably kill anything that walks,
just for fun, and will tend to rob shops as a principle.

Neutral:  Neutrality tends to be a refusal to take sides.  The attitude of a
neutral is basically "live and let live."  A character who is neutral
probably won't kill creatures that aren't bothering it, but won't have any
qualms about killing those that do.  A neutral character won't really care
about robbing from shops, as long as it will benefit him/her.

Lawful:  A lawful character has aligned him/herself with the side of good.
He/she will tend to follow societal rules, even if it won't benefit him/her.
A lawful character will have the attitude that "there is a higher good."
Lawful characters usually will try to befriend other creatures, but may
attempt to hunt down and kill those creatures that are by their very nature
"evil."  (Chaotic monsters especially would be considered to be "evil" by a
lawful type.)  A lawful character would never even think of robbing a shop.

Now, here's how alignment works in nethack:  There is a number associated
with your alignment, which will determine if you are "stridently aligned,"
etc.  This number is increased for every action you perform which is in
keeping with your alignment, and decreased for every action you perform which
would be against your alignment.  Thus, if a lawful character were to rob a
shop or kill a lawful creature, this alignment would be decreased.  If a
chaotic character, on the other hand, were to do the very same thing, the
number would be increased.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carrying Capacity:

In order to compute the carrying capacity of a character, you need to know
three things:  the character's strength, level, and if either leg is wounded.
Strength is divided into two parts, and is shown as str/nn.  Str ranges from
1 to 18 (and can jump to 25 with gauntlets of power), and nn ranges from 01
to ** (** is used since 100 won't fit in the two digit space).

There are two different methods for computing your carrying capacity,
depending on how your game of nethack was originally compiled.  On most
systems, nethack is compiled with the HARD option set to on.  If that is the
case on your system, use Method 1 for computing your carrying capacity.  If
your system has HARD set to off, use Method 2 for computing your carrying
capacity.

In either case, how strength affects carrying capacity varies depending upon
the strength.  The character's level is always multiplied by five and added
into the carrying capacity (although in Method 1, you only can count the
first 16 levels for this), and finally, for each wounded leg (either the
left, right, or both can be wounded) you have to subtract ten from the
carrying capacity.  Thus, the formulae for figuring out your carrying
capacity are as follows:

Method 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Strength | Capacity                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-18     | 5*level + 5*str - 10*(wounded legs)                            |
| 18/01-25 | 5*level(up to level 16) + 40 - 10*(wounded legs)               |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Strength     | Capacity                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-18         | 5*level + 5*str - 10*(wounded legs)                        |
| 18/01-18/50  | 5*level + 90 + nn - 10*(wounded legs)                      |
| 18/51-18/75  | 5*level + 140 + 2*(nn-50) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
| 18/76-18/90  | 5*level + 190 + 3*(nn-75) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
| 18/91-18/95  | 5*level + 235 + 5*(nn-90) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
| 18/96-18/99  | 5*level + 260 + 10*(nn-95) - 10*(wounded legs)             |
| 18/**        | 5*level + 410 - 10*(wounded legs)                          |
| 25           | 5*level + 380 - 10*(wounded legs)                          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interestingly enough, with Method 2, a strength of 25 doesn't allow as much
of a carrying capacity as 18/** does.

In either case, when you are levitating, your carrying capacity is
automatically at maximum.

The archeologist in nethack is basically an Indiana Jones clone.  The
clothing is the same, the abilities are the same, and to all intents and
purposes, the goals are the same:  Survive, explore, and bring back lots of
exotic treasures!

The archeologist starts with the innate ability to identify any gem.

Alignment: Chaotic

Conan was, is, and always will be the classic example of a barbarian.  Good
wine, good food, good money, and good women are what a barbarian considers to
be the most important aspects of life, and they will do almost anything in
their pursuit of these things, including delving deep into the dungeons of
nethack.

Elves are hardy folk of humanoid stock.  Nethack elves are fashioned after
Tolkien's elves, and as such are tall, thin, and light of foot.  Elves have
excellent vision, and thus are more likely to notice things like secret
doors.

The healer has dedicated his life to medicine and have the capability to
restore hit points through their spells.  Healers are not trained in the
skills of fighting, but when in need, healers can turn their sharpened

The knight is considered by many to be one of the hardest nethack characters
to play.  The knight does not start with exceptional items, does not gain
much as he goes along, and is constrained by many more rules than normal
characters, because of the code of chivalry that a knight must follow.

The priest is a cleric who has set him/herself apart for service to his/her
deity.  Priests begin the game blessed with the ability to immediately
determine whether items are cursed, uncursed, or blessed.  Also, since many
orders have injunctions against the shedding of blood, priests are trained in
kicking instead, and get bonuses when doing so.

Wizards are considered by many to be a difficult character to play, because
they are very poor fighters when they start.  However, with a little bit of
luck, a wizard can end up being one of the most powerful characters in the
game.


* There some are limitations on the generation of random magic items.  These
are delineated as follows:

1. No "useless" items will be generated.  The following items are considered
(by the game) to be useless items:
     potion of hallucination
     scroll of amnesia
     scroll of fire
     ring of aggravate monster
     ring of hunger
     wand of nothing

2. No ring of levitation will be generated.

3. It is impossible to begin the game with both polymorph and polymorph
control.  In other words, if your character has a ring, wand, or spellbook of
polymorph, he/she will not have a ring of polymorph control, and vice-versa.

4. Two of the same ring will not be generated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character Stats:

The following is information about each of the major character stats.  They
are listed in the order in which they appear on the status line - not in
alphabetical order.  All stats can be increased by quaffing potions of gain
ability.

St (Strength):                                        ---------------------
Strength affects various aspects of combat in nethack |St.        |Hit|Dam |
(see the HIT PROBABILITY and DAMAGE sections for      |-------------------|
details on how these bonuses work).  Additionally,    |01-05      |-2 | -1 |
strength affects your carrying capacity (see CARRYING |06-07      |-1 |  0 |
CAPACITY section for more details).  Also, the        |08-15      | 0 |  0 |
distance you can throw objects, your chances of       |16         | 0 | +1 |
bashing down a door or kicking open a lock, and your  |17         |+1 | +1 |
chances of opening a stuck door (among other things)  |18         |+1 | +2 |
are affected by your strength.  It is possible to     |18/01-18/50|+1 | +3 |
increase strength by eating royal jelly, giant        |18/51-18/75|+2 | +3 |
corpses, or wearing gauntlets of power.               |18/76-18/90|+2 | +4 |
                                                      |18/91-18/99|+2 | +5 |
                                                      |18/**-25   |+3 | +6 |
                                                      ----------------------
-------------------- Dx (Dexterity):
|Dx.   | Mle | Msl | Your dexterity is your ability to dodge, your agility,
|------------------| and your manual dexterity, all rolled into one.
|01-03 |  -3 |  -3 | Dexterity affects how likely you are to hit (see HIT
|04-05 |  -2 |  -2 | PROBABILITY for more information).  Note that on the
|06-07 |  -1 |  -1 | table to the right, to hit bonuses are different for
|08-14 |   0 |   0 | melee than they are for missile weapons.  In other
|15    |  +1 |   0 | words, if you are fighting hand to hand, you receive a
|16    |  +2 |  +1 | different bonus that if you are using a bow, sling,
|17    |  +3 |  +2 | etc.)  Dexterity also affects how well you can use a
|*     |   * |   * | harp.  To increase your dexterity, wear gauntlets of
|25    | +11 | +10 | dexterity.
--------------------
* Each bonus continues to increase by one as the stat increases by one, up to
25, which is the maximum the stat can reach.

Co (Constitution):                                          ----------------
Constitution is a measure of how healthy you are.           |Co.       |HP+|
Constitution affects how quickly your character heals, but  |--------------|
the major benefit of constitution is extra hit points as    |3         |-2 |
each level is gained.  When a character gains a higher      |4-6       |-1 |
experience level, the character's current and maximum hit   |7-14      | 0 |
points are raised by a random amount.  This random amount   |15-16     |+1 |
is modified by a bonus which is determined by the           |17        |+2 |
constitution of the character (see the table to the right). |18        |+3 |
                                                            ----------------

In (Intelligence)
Intelligence plays an important part in determining if you will be able to
memorize a spell by reading a spellbook.  It also is factored into your
chances of casting any given spell that you have memorized (see MAGIC for
more details on both of these).  Finally, intelligence determines how often
your power will recharge (wisdom determined how many points recharge each
time).  Your intelligence can also be increased by wearing a helm of
brilliance.

Wi (Wisdom)
Wisdom is taken into account when you pray to your god.  It also affects how
many energy points you will gain when you go up an experience level, and how
many power points you will recharge each time you recharge (intelligence
affects how often they recharge).  Wisdom can be increased by wearing a helm
of brilliance.

Ch (Charisma):                                            ------------------
"Beauty is only skin deep."  Well, in nethack beauty is   |Ch.     |  Mod  |
charisma, and charisma affects a couple of key things in  |----------------|
the game.  First of all, charisma affects the prices a    |3-5     | *2.00 |
shopkeeper will give you in a shop (see the table to the  |6-7     | *1.66 |
right for price modifiers).  The other major affect is    |8-10    | *1.33 |
that charisma adds to your chances of having a beneficial |11-15   | *1.00 |
encounter when faced with a succubus/incubus.  It is      |16-17   | *0.75 |
possible to increase charisma with a ring of adornment    |18      | *0.66 |

Score:

The following formula can be used to compute what any character's score is:

       player gold            (see explanation)
     + real experience        (see explanation)
     + max dungeon level bonus     (see formula)
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     * ascension bonus        (see explanation)
     + gem values             (see explanation)
     + amulet values          (see explanation)
     + pet bonus              (see explanation)
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
       score

Player gold:  Take the amount of gold the character has in his/her
     possession, and subtract 10% if the character died or was killed (not if
     the character ascended, escaped, or quit).

Real experience:  This is the number of experience points that have actually
     been gained from slaying monsters, not including experience points that
     may have been gained via potions of gain level, eating wraith corpses,
     etc.

Max dungeon level bonus:  Compute this bonus as follows: (50 * maximum
     dungeon level visited) + 1000 for each level between 21 and 30 attained
     (a level is considered "attained" if the maximum dungeon level visited
     is greater than that level)

Ascension bonus:  If the character has ascended to demigod(dess)hood,
     multiply the score computed up to this point by 2.  Otherwise, just keep
     it the way it is.

Gem values:  If you escaped or ascended, add the gold value of each gem
     currently possessed by the character to the score (see GEMS section for
     exact gold values).

Amulet values:  If you escaped or ascended, add 2 points for each amulet
     possessed with a negative value (i.e. a -2 amulet of protection), add
     500 points for each non-negative amulet possessed (i.e. an amulet of
     reflection), and add 5000 points if the Amulet of Yendor is in your
     character's possession.

Pet bonus:  If you escaped or ascended, and you did so with pets, add the
     maximum hit points of each pet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status Line:


At the bottom of the nethack screen appears a status line.  This status line
(which is really two lines) will give you a lot of information about the
character being played at a glance.  The following is a sample status line:

Endiel the Evoker  St:9 Dx:16 Co:15 In:15 Wi:10 Ch:13  Neutral S:132
Dlvl:3  G:325  HP:21(35) Pw:8(11) AC:4  Xp:3/53 T:461

Now, item by item we will describe what each part of the status line means:

1. "Endiel the Evoker" is the name and rank of the character.  The name will
be either your account name or a name that you have chosen (see COMMON
QUESTIONS for more information about how to name your character).  The rank
is dependent upon your character class (i.e. wizard, samurai, barbarian,
etc.) and your experience level (see CLASS RANKS for a list of the ranks).

2. "St: 9 Dx:16 Co:15 In:15 Wi:10 Ch:13" is a listing of what the character's
stats are.  Respectively, this line would mean that the character's strength
is 9, dexterity is 16, constitution is 15, intelligence is 15, wisdom is 10,
and charisma is 13 (see CHARACTER STATS for more information about what these
stats mean).

3. "Neutral" is the character's alignment.  Alignment can be one of three
things:  "Chaotic," "Neutral," or "Good."  Alignment is a tricky subject, but
in general it determines whether you tend to be on the side of "good" or
"evil" or just sit the fence, and your character's actions are judged
accordingly.  Alignment is initially determined by character class, but can
also be changed during play via several different methods (see ALIGNMENT for
more details).

4. "S:132" is the character's score.  If the character were to quit the game
at this moment, the score listed would be the score received.  There is a
score penalty for dying.  Some compilations of nethack will not show score.
(For more information on how to compute score, see SCORE.)

5. "Dlvl:3" means that this character is on dungeon level three, or the third
level down.  In nethack, dungeon levels are counted downwards, so the first
level you encounter is level one, and then you go down through levels two,
three, four, and so on.  Level fifty is the lowest level in the dungeon.

6. "G:325" is the amount of gold ($) the character has.  This character has
325 gold pieces in his/her possession.

7. "HP:21(35)" is two measurements:  the character's current and maximum hit
points (HP).  The current hit points are how many you have right now, and the
maximum is what you can raise your current hit points to.  Basically, hit
points are a measure of how alive you are.  Your current hit points are
decreased when you are hit by a monster, caught in a trap, or do many other
things that damage you.  Hit points are healed naturally over time, or can be
increased via potions of healing, praying, etc.  Maximum hit points is raised
automatically whenever you go up an experience level, or may be increased via
praying, quaffing healing potions while your current hit points are equal to
the maximum, etc.

8. "Pw:8(11)" is also two measurements:  your current and maximum power.
Current power is used to cast spells that have been memorized from spell
books.  It is regenerated naturally over time, or can be increased via
potions of gain energy.  Maximum power is increased whenever the character
increases an experience level, or can be increased by quaffing potions of
gain energy while current energy is at maximum.

9. "AC:4" is the character's armor class.  Armor class (AC) is a measure of
how well protected the character is against blows from hostile monsters.
Armor class starts at 10, and goes downwards as it gets better.  Thus, a
character with an AC of -10 would be much better than a character with an AC
of 5.  AC can be improved by wearing more or better or more enchanted armor,
by wearing rings of protection, by having your deity grant you intrinsic
protection, or by other methods.

10. "Xp:3/53" is, once again, two measurements:  the character's experience
level and experience points.  Experience points (always the second and larger
figure) are gained by killing monsters, quaffing potions of gain level, etc.,
and are the determining factor for what your experience level is.  Experience
points also affect your score.  A character's experience level (or just
"level" for short) determines many other factors about the character, such as
maximum hit points, power, some intrinsics, ability to convert altars, etc.
In general, the higher the character's experience level, the better the
character is.

11. "T:461" shows the "time," or the number of moves that the character has
made.  Every time the character does anything, this counter is incremented by
one.  This timer is optional, and can be turned on or off by using the "O"
key for the options command.  In most compilations of nethack it is set to
off by default.

Monster Attacks:

This section details the number and types of attacks each monster has, as
well as how much damage they can do for each attack, and what type of damage
is done.  Each monster can have from one to five attacks (except the mail
daemon, which doesn't attack).  These attacks are listed in the order in
which they will occur, in the following format:  Attack-type Damage (Damage
type)

Attack types, damage, and damage types are explained below the chart.

Attack types:  The various attack types possible for an attack are listed
below, with a brief explanation for each.

     Attack Type     Description
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Bite            The monster will attempt to bite you.
     Breath          With this attack type, the monster will breathe at you,
                     usually breathing a gas, liquid, fire, or the like.  The
                     classical example of this is the fire breathing dragon
                     (a red dragon in nethack and most fantasy role playing
                     games).
     Butt            The monster will head-butt you, much in the same way
                     that a bull would, usually in order to bring a horn into
                     play.
     Claw            The monster attacks using its claws.
     Defensive       This attack type will only occur if you successfully
                     attack (i.e. hit) the monster in question.  I.E. this is
                     a retributive strike.
     Engulf          The monster will attempt to engulf you.  This can
                     involve swallowing you whole, as a purple worm would do,
                     or simply surrounding you, as a fog cloud would.
     Explode         With this attack type, the monster will literally
                     explode if you come within range of it, and the
                     explosion does the damage.
     Gaze            The monster will look at you in order attack.  Usually
                     you have to meet the monster's gaze in order for the
                     attack to be successful.
     Hug             With this attack type, the monster will use a crushing
                     bear- like hug in order to incapacitate you as well as
                     prevent you from running away.
     Kick            The monster will kick you.  For example, a horse (if it
                     were a nethack monster) would probably kick you.  Temple
                     priest(ess)s also use kicking attacks.
     Magic           The monster will use a magic spell to attack.
     Spit            The monster will spit at you, and if the liquid that is
                     spat touches you, the attack is successful.  A prime
                     example of this type of attack would be the spitting
                     cobra.
     Sting           The monster will attempt to sting you with a stinger.
     Touch           In order to successfully attack with this attack type,
                     the monster need only touch you.
     Weapon          The monster in question will use a weapon of some type
                     in order to do the damage listed.  Thus, monsters with
                     this attack type will always be generated with weapons.

Damage: Damage is listed in the format xdy.  In this format, x is the number
of dice rolled to determine the damage, and y is the number of faces on each
die rolled.  Thus, if '1d6' were listed, it would mean that one six-sided die
would be rolled to determine the damage, giving a possible range of 1-6.  If
'3d8' were listed, it would mean that three eight-sided dice would be rolled
to determine the damage, giving a possible range of 3-24.

Note: where "LEV" is listed (i.e. "LEVd4" or "(LEV+1)d4"), substitute the
monster's level.

Note that with some damage types, the damage indicated here will not be used
for actual hit point damage to the character, but may be used (for example)
to determine the length of paralyzation or blindness, etc.


Damage types:  The various damage types possible for an attack are listed
below, with a brief explanation for each.  The default damage type (i.e. if
no damage type is listed for the attack) is "Physical."

     Damage Type     Description
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Acid            The damage done in this case is via acid.  Thus, if you
                     are acid resistant (only certain monsters are), you
                     would take no damage.
     Amulet          Monsters with this damage type (basically the Wizard of
                     Yendor only) will attempt to steal the Amulet of Yendor
                     (assuming you have it).
     Blind           This damage type is used in conjuction with the engulf,
                     explode, and spit attack types.  With the engulf attack
                     type, normal damage is done, and you will be blinded
                     until you manage to kill the creature or are expelled
                     from it. With the explode attack type, you will be
                     blinded for a number of rounds equal to the listed
                     damage, but no damage will be taken.  For the spit
                     attack type, you will take normal damage and be blinded
                     for 1-25 rounds.
     Cleric Spl      Monsters with this damage type will cast a random cleric
                     spell, having random effects depending upon the spell
                     cast.
     Cold            The damage is done via cold or freezing.  Thus, if you
                     are cold resistant, no damage will be done.  However,
                     this type of damage also has a chance of destroying
                     potions.
     Con.            Damage of this type has the possibility of being
                     poisoned. If the attack is poisoned, your character will
                     lose 3 to 5 points of constitution in addition to the
                     normal damage taken.
     Confuse         An attack doing damage of this type will confuse you for
                     the number of rounds that would normally be damage.
                     (i.e. if 1d6 is listed for damage, you would be confused
                     for 1d6 rounds).  No normal damage is received, however.
     Curse           If an attack using this damage type succeeds, the
                     attacking monster will "steal" one of your intrinsics.
     Decay           This damage type, in addition to doing normal damage,
                     has the capability of decaying organic material.  Thus,
                     it can damage armor that is organic in nature (i.e.
                     robes, leather armor, etc.).
     Dex.            Damage of this type has the possibility of being
                     poisoned. If the attack is poisoned, your character will
                     lose 3 to 5 points of dexterity in addition to the
                     normal damage taken.
     Digest          This damage type occurs only in conjunction with the
                     attack type "Engulf."  Basically, once the monster has
                     swallowed you whole, any damage done if via digestion in
                     the monster's stomach.
     Disease         In addition to the normal damage done, you also have a
                     chance of becoming sick and eventually dying of it.
     Disint./Death   This type of attack will usually kill you outright.
                     However, if the attack is a disintegration beam and you
                     are wearing armor, your outermost layer of armor will be
                     destroyed instead.
     Drain Energy    Damage of this type is done by draining the amount of
                     damage from your store of energy points instead of from
                     hit points.
     Drain Life      Monsters doing this kind of damage have a chance of
                     draining an experience level from you in addition to the
                     normal damage done.
     Fire            The damage is done via fire or heat.  Thus, if you are
                     fire resistant, no damage will be done.  This type of
                     damage also has a chance of catching scrolls and
                     spellbooks on fire, and causing potions to boil and
                     burst.
     Heal            This is probably the most unique of all the damage
                     types, and is basically reserved for nurses.  If you are
                     wearing any type of armor, or are wielding any weapon
                     when this damage type is done to you, normal damage will
                     occur (unless you are a healer, in which case you'll get
                     a fun message).  If, however, you aren't wearing any
                     armor, and are not wielding any weapon, you will
                     actually be healed by the attack, and if already at
                     maximum hit points, there is a chance that your maximum
                     will be increased by one point.
     Legs            Monsters doing this type of damage attack and do damage
                     primarily to your legs.  Such damage can incapacitate
                     you and prevent you from walking or fighting, especially
                     if you're carrying a heavy load.
     Lycanthropy     Monsters with this damage type have a chance of not only
                     doing normal damage, but also conferring lycanthropy
                     upon you.  If you catch lycanthropy (signified by the
                     message, "You feel feverish."), you will periodically
                     change form into a rat, jackal, or wolf, depending upon
                     which type of lycanthrope you got the disease from.
     Mag. Mis.       Attacks with this damage type are made via magic
                     missiles. If you are magic resistant, no damage will be
                     sustained.
     Paralyze        For most attack types, this kind of damage includes not
                     only the normal physical damage, but also the chance of
                     being paralyzed for a random time period.  However, for
                     "Defensive" attacks, no damage is done, and you will be
                     paralyzed for the number of rounds listed as damage.
     Petrify         Monsters doing this type of damage have a chance of
                     turning you to stone.  Generally the stoning (as it's
                     called) starts with the limbs, and then proceeds to the
                     rest of the body.
     Physical        The damage done is physical in nature (i.e. a cut to the
                     torso, etc.).
     Rust            Damage of this type has the capability of rusting metal.
                     If the attack type is defensive in nature, the weapon
                     you used to attack can rust.  Otherwise, any metal armor
                     you might be wearing can rust.
     Seduce          Monsters with this damage type will attempt to seduce
                     you and will steal as many of your items as possible
                     while they are seducing you.  Incubi/Succubi have
                     slightly different effects with this damage type, and
                     can have effects ranging from giving you experience to
                     outright killing you.
     Shock           Damage of this type is done via electrical shock.  Thus,
                     if you are shock resistant, no damage will be done.
                     However, this damage also has a chance of destroying
                     wands and rings.
     Sleep           If an attack doing sleep damage succeeds, there is a
                     chance that you will be put to sleep for a random time
                     period in addition to the normal damage.  Sleep
                     resistance will prevent you from being put to sleep, but
                     you will still sustain the normal damage.
     Slow            Attacks doing damage of this type have the possibility
                     of not only doing normal damage, but also of slowing you
                     down to normal speed if you are moving at faster than
                     normal speed.
     Spell           Monsters with this damage type will cast a random magic-
                     user spell, having varying effects depending upon the
                     spell cast.
     Steal           Monsters with this damage type will attempt to steal an
                     item from your inventory.
     Steal $         Monsters with this damage type will attempt to steal any
                     gold which you might have.
     Stick           If an attack doing damage of this type succeeds, in
                     addition to doing the normal damage, you will be unable
                     to escape the monster in the next round.
     Str.            Damage of this type has the possibility of being
                     poisoned. If the attack is poisoned, your character will
                     lose 3 to 5 points of strength in addition to the normal
                     damage taken.
     Stun            An attack doing damage of this type will stun you for
                     the number of rounds that would normally be damage.
                     (i.e. if 1d6 is listed for damage, you would be stunned
                     for 1d6 rounds).  In addition to stunning you for this
                     time period, you will take damage equal to one-half of
                     the time period you are stunned.  (I.e., let's say the
                     monster can do 1d6 damage.  Let's say it rolls a 4 for
                     that 1d6.  Thus, you would be stunned for 4 rounds, and
                     take 2 hit points of damage.)  The exception to all this
                     is "Defensive" attacks, where you will be stunned as per
                     a normal stun attack, but no physical damage is taken.
     Teleport        Monsters doing damage of this type can, in addition to
                     doing normal damage, teleport you to another spot on the
                     level.
     Wrap            This is a special damage type which is similar to
                     "Stick." However, this damage type is reserved for eels,
                     and if successful, in addition to keeping you from
                     running away the next round, there is a chance that you
                     will be dragged into the water.

Following is a description of the contents of each column:

Lvl  This column contains the level of the monster.  Level determines items
     the monster's hit points, how many experience points it's worth, etc.
Spd  This is the monster's speed.  Compare this with your standard
     character's speed of 10.
AC   This is the monster's armor class.  The lower this is, the harder it
     will be to hit the monster.
MR   This is the magic resistance of the monster, and it is the percentage
     chance that any spell hitting the monster has of failing.
Aln  This is the monster's alignment.  C = Chaotic, N = Neutral, and L =
     Lawful
Wgt  This is the weight of the monster.  Consequently, it is also the weight
     of any corpse the monster may leave.
Nutr This is the nutritional value that can be gained from the monster's
     corpse, if eaten.
Siz  This is the size of the monster, as may be used to compute weapon
     damage.  S is smaller than human size, and L is larger than human size.

* Just for the physics types, these are the names of the Quantum Mechanics.

Following is a description of the various intrinsics listed in the monster
information section above.  Note that not all possible intrinsic flags for
each monster were listed, as we consider some of them to be unimportant to
play of the game.  If an intinsic is preceded with an asterisk (*) here, the
corpse of any monster with that intrinsic can have an effect upon or confer
an intrisic to a player if eaten.  See the FOOD - CORPSES section for more
information about corpses conferring intrinsics or having other effects.

Castle Level:

Contrary to popular belief, the castle (or stronghold) level is not where the
wizard is.  The castle level is more of a proving ground - if you can get by
it, you can probably finish the game, and if you do finish it, there are
excellent rewards (specifically, there is a wand of wishing in one of the
outer four rooms).  Beware, though.  Although this level is littered with
loot (four whole rooms full of stuff to start with), it's also littered with
monsters.  Guards abound, as well as at least four dragons, several lichs,
some nagas, and so on.  An example castle level is below:

The first hint that you are on the castle level is the fact that you will
appear in the upper-left corner of the map, and in a maze to boot.  You will
also tend to hear 'courtly sounds'.  The maze you are in (see map above) is
not large, but beware, for a minotaur lurks within, and they are more than a
little trouble.

After you complete the maze, you will be on a large landing, with the castle
in front of you and the moat around it.  The moat will drown you in a second,
so beware.  Also, there are invisible giant eels in the water and they will
attack you.  The first question asked is:  How do I get in?  Well, there are
many answers, so I will outline several ideas below:

If you have sacrificed enough, your god will have given you five musical
notes when you pray.  Play these notes on an instrument, and the drawbridge
will open.  If your god hasn't given you the five musical notes, try random
notes. You'll get a series of sounds.  Use these sounds like the old Master
Mind game to determine the correct notes.  (One sound means correct note,
correct spot. The other means correct note, wrong spot.)  Keep trying until
the drawbridge comes down.

A wand of opening or a spellbook of knock will cause the drawbridge to come
down - but watch out!  If you are standing directly in front of the
drawbridge, it will fall on you and squash you.  A wand of striking will
disintegrate the portcullis, but you still have to bridge the moat to get in.
Try pushing in a boulder, zapping a wand of cold or fire at the moat, or
using water walking, levitation, or jumping boots.

Another method of entering the castle is by polymorphing yourself into a
xorn. A xorn can walk through the walls of the castle straight into the
middle.  Be warned, though - xorns can't swim, so you'll still have to bridge
the moat.

A final method of getting in is using the back door.  Using boots of
levitation or water walking (or equivalent items or spells), walk through the
moat around to the back of the castle.  Pick the lock on the back door and
walk in.  Be careful of the trapdoors, though!

Once you're into the castle, if you're not prepared to fight for your life
against ravenous hordes of monsters, there are two ways of getting rid of
most of them (albeit forfeiting the experience for killing them).  Either use
a ring of conflict or walk back over the trapdoors, letting them all go
falling down into the upper level of hell as they try to follow you.  Kill
off the rest, grab the wand of wishing, try sitting on the throne for another
wish or two, and then go for the ultimate challenge - the Wizard himself, by
teleporting down to level fifty or so.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Levels:

Nethack has several "special levels."  The actual level of each of these
varies from game to game, so we can't tell you what level to look for each
on, but we can give you a description of each so that you recognize what
you're running into.

Big Level:  Basically, this level is exactly what the name implies.  The
entire level is one big room.  This is a bad level to have aggravate monster
on, and a ring of conflict is really handy here.  Here's an example of a big
level:

Castle/Stronghold Level:  see section CASTLE LEVEL

Medusa Level:  Of all the creatures of Greek mythology, the gorgons   -------
were among the most powerful.  One of these was the medusa, whose     |.``..|
visage was so terrible to behold that one look at her countenance     -...`.|
would turn any living creature instantly to stone.  She was finally   |...`.|
slain by Perseus with the use of a reflective shield given him by     |.@..`|
Athena.  It is rumored that the only two ways to kill a medusa are    -------
to fight her without gazing upon her, or to reflect her terrible gaze back
upon her, so that she, looking upon her own reflection, should turn to stone.
The medusa is raised back to life in nethack, so beware of the level upon
which she resides.  You will know you are there when you begin to see an
inordinately large number of statues, hear nothing but silence, etc. A sample
room in which the medusa might reside is above at right.

Oracle of Delphi:  The Oracle of Delphi was reknowned in ancient      -|-@--
times for her ability to tell the future with admirable accuracy.     |.```|
For instance, a great king once came to the Oracle and asked if he    |....|
should send his armies against the armies of another nation.  The     |..{.|
Oracle told him, "I tell you truly.  If you do so, you will destroy   ------
a mighty army."  Enheartened, he attacked, and sure enough, a mighty army was
destroyed - his own!  The Oracle in nethack will give you minor or major
consultations.  Minor ones are cheap, and are the same as a fortune cookie.
Major ones are expensive, but can give some good clues.  The oracle room will
have the oracle sitting in a niche in the wall, with statues of mountain,
plain, and forest centaurs in front of her, and a fountain in the room.  An
example is shown above at right.

Rogue Level:  Rogue was one of the first of the hack and slash games.  Hack,
Nethack, UltraRogue, Moria, UMoria, Larn, Omega, and undoubtedly many more,
were all based on the idea started by rogue.  Now, rogue, like early versions
of hack, had a very distinctive look.  There were always nine rooms on each
level, and each wall of each room never had more than one doorway.  In memory
of rogue, the nethack engineers have added a "rogue level," that looks very
much like the original rogue game, and the game will tell you that it seems
like you've been on that level before.  Here's an example of one:

Tower Levels:  The three tower levels are the three levels that probably
generate more confusion that the entire rest of the game combined (a little
hyperbole, but not a lot).  Basically, the tower levels are three consecutive
maze levels in hell.  In the center of each of these maze levels is the a
section of the tower proper.  The tower can only be entered from the lowest
level, and there's no exit at the top.  Inside the tower are many riches, and
vampires galore.  On the top level of the tower, you'll find Vlad the
Impaler, master of the tower. (Oh, did I forget to mention that he's also a
Vampire Lord?)  Below is an example of the three tower sections.  Put each of
them in the center of a maze level, and you've got a tower level!

Wizard Level:  The wizard level is (you guessed it) where the Wizard  }}}}}}}
of Yendor lives.  He has a little room in the middle of an otherwise  }}---}}
normal maze level.  Now, the trick is that this little room looks     }--^--}
just like the little rooms that are on about half of the maze         }|^^^|}
levels.  Only one of them holds the Wizard of Yendor, and the real    }--^--}
Amulet of Yendor, though, so don't be fooled.  The best way to tell   }}---}}
where you are in relation to the Wizard is to put on a blindfold and  }}}}}}}
apply a mirror to yourself (use '.' for direction).  After a few tries, this
will tell you whether the wizard is above you, below you, or very close.
When you're on the same level, trek in towards the middle, get past the moat,
break into his home, and take the Amulet!  An example of the Wizard's room is
above at right. Incidentally, the traps are squeaky boards which will
instantly wake up the Wizard.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Rooms:

There are many varied and interesting rooms to explore in nethack.  Besides
your standard room with the possibility of randomly generated items, traps,
monsters, etc., there are several special room types that can be found within
the dungeon.  These are listed below:

Beehives:  Beehives are (you guessed it) rooms completely filled      -------
with killer bees.  There are usually one or more queen bees in one    |.aaaa|
as well.  Beehives can be quite nasty for the inexperienced           -.aaaa|
character, but if you can manage to kill them off, run around         |.aaaa|
picking up the royal jelly that will be left behind.  Eat it, and     |.aaaa|
hey presto -instant strength!                                         -------

Barracks:  The barracks are a room type that will usually only show   -------
up on lower levels due to the fact that it will kill of all but the   |.@@@@|
most  powerful characters.  Barracks are rooms filled with soldiers.  -.@@@@|
Be careful not to blow a whistle or play a bugle on the level if you  |.@@@@|
don't want to face them. Soldiers will always wake up for a whistle   |.@@@@|
or a bugle, and come to investigate what woke them!                   -------

David's Treasure Zoo:  David's Treasure Zoo is a room totally filled  -------
with random monsters of all types and sizes.  This room can be quite  |.DooQ|
deadly, but each monster in the room will carry a sizeable sum of     -.aggh|
gold, so if you can kill off all of them, you'll probably end up      |.dCkq|
quite rich.  Wands and other ray type weapons, rings of conflict,     |.qoGc|
the ability to teleport out if you have to can be quite handy here,   -------
as in any room filled with monsters.

Graveyards:  If you have a character with a bad AC, you'd better      -------
pray that you don't run into one of these.  Graveyards are rooms      |W WZV|
filled with nasty undead creatures - wraiths and vampires that will   -ZZSWS|
drain your levels away, and zombies and skeletons and ghosts.  (Note  |VSW V|
that ghosts in a graveyard are randomly generated, although they may  |WWZZ |
take names from the high score file.  Thus, they won't leave ghost    -------
stacks.)  If you have a character with a good AC, these can be quite a boost:
Kill off all the wraiths and eat the corpses to go up many levels!

Shops:  Shops can be an adventurer's best friend.  Note that I said   -------
shops, not shopkeepers - shopkeepers can be an adventurer's worst     |@??!!|
nightmare!  Shops come in all sizes and types.  There are shops that  -.%[))|
sell everything, and shops that specialize in an item type (wands,    |.[!%(|
for instance).  Shopkeepers always carry a key and a lot of gold,     |.!?/=|
and they guard their wares jealously.  Check out the section on       -------
ROBBING SHOPS for more information on how to rob shopkeepers blind.

Temples:  A temple is a room that is dedicated to a particular        -------
deity.  Temples invariably contain an altar to that deity in the      |.....|
center of the room, and a priest(ess) of that deity nearby.  You can  -..@..|
give an offering to the deity by #chatting to the priest(ess), and    |.._..|
will perhaps have a blessing bestowed upon you.  You'll know you're   |.....|
entering a temple when you get a message along the lines of           -------
"Pilgrim, you enter a holy place."

Throne Rooms:  A throne room is a room filled with monsters.  The     -------
major difference between this room and David's Treasure Zoo is that   |.kodk|
throne rooms have a throne in them.  Sitting on this throne can       -.ooG\|
produce all sort of interesting effects, and gold can be gotten (if   |.dkgh|
you're lucky) by kicking the throne.  See the THRONE EFFECTS and      |.qCoc|
KICKING sections for more information about thrones.                  -------

Vaults:  Vaults are scattered about the various levels, and can       ----
never be entered except by digging, teleporting, or walking through   |$$|
walls (they have no doors).  Most levels with one of these two by     |$$|
two rooms filled with gold will also have a closet with a single use  ----
teleport trap in it.  That teleport trap will teleport you into the vault
(just be sure you have a way to get out).  Oh, and remember - Croesus was the
king who commissioned the vaults, and all of the vault guards know him.

          ----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damage:

If you would like to figure out how much damage you can do to a given monster
upon a successful hit, this section will tell you how.  Please note that all
computations will involve ranges, so you will end up with a minimum and
maximum amount of damage you can do to a monster.

The following formula can be used to compute damage when attacking a monster:

       weapon damage value    (see explanation)
     + undead/demon bonus     (see explanation)
     + weapon enchantment     (see explanation)
     + relative damage bonus  (see explanation)
     + special bonuses        (see chart)
     + ring bonus             (see explanation)
     + strength bonus         (see chart)
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
       total damage done

Weapon damage value:  The weapon damage value will be listed in the WEAPONS
section as a minimum and maximum value.  Just look up the weapon that you're
using and take either the small or large monster value depending upon what
type of monster you're fighting.  If the "weapon" you're using isn't really a
weapon, but is some other object, look at the chart at the end of this
section for information on the damage values of other objects.  Undead/demon
bonus:  If the weapon you are fighting with is blessed, and the monster you
are fighting is undead or a demon, you will do an extra one to four points of
damage.

Weapon enchantment:  This is whatever the "plus" on the weapon is.  For
instance, if it's a +3 crysknife, you can add another +3 here.

Relative damage bonus:  The relative damage bonus is only figured in for
artifacts (named weapons).  See the section on ARTIFACTS to look up the
relative damage bonus on a named weapon.  Also, please note that if "x2" is
listed for the relative damage bonus, it means to total everything up to the
relative damage bonus in the above equation and double it.  Then you can
continue adding the other bonuses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Special bonuses:                                                | Bonus |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|weapon is boomerang, is thrown, and breaks                      | +1    |
|weapon is silver arrow, and is used versus a lycanthrope,       |       |
|   minor demon (except tengus) or major demon                   | +1-20 |
|if the weapon drains life (also removes one level from monster) | +1-8  |
|if the weapon is poisoned (or can kill monster outright)        | +1-6  |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ring bonus:  The ring bonus is only figured in if you are wearing a ring of
increase damage.  If so, take the enchantment on the ring (for instance, 2 if
you're wearing a +1 ring of increase damage) and add it in here.

-----------------------
| Strength    | Bonus |
|---------------------|
| 01-05       |  -1   |
| 06-15       |   0   |
| 16-17       |  +1   |
| 18          |  +2   |
| 18/01-18/75 |  +3   |
| 18/76-18/90 |  +4   |
| 18/91-18/99 |  +5   |
| 18/**-25    |  +6   |
-----------------------

These objects use the following for the weapon damage value:
----------------------------------------------------------
| Object                                          | Dam  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| bare hands                                      | 1-2  |
| boulder                                         | 1-20 |
| bow (any type when used to bash)                | 1-2  |
| clove of garlic (undead will flee)              | 1    |
| egg                                             | 1    |
| corpse (depends on size)                        | 1-5  |
| heavy iron ball                                 | 1-25 |
| mirror (also -2 luck)                           | 1    |
| potion                                          | 1    |
----------------------------------------------------------

Finally, all other objects except cameras and cream pies use a weapon damage
value based upon their weight (cameras and cream pies cannot do damage):
     damage value = weight/10 (minimum of 1, maximum of 6)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fountain Effects:

There are basically two things you can do at a fountain.  You can either
quaff of dip something.  Different effects can occur when you do these as
follows:

Quaffing at the fountain:

|       | "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."  (if   |

| 1/30  | "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain."               |
|       | Just exactly like it sounds - creates several pools in the room.  |
|       |  (Note:  this cannot happen in a room with a staircase.)          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dipping an item at a fountain:

If the item is a longsword, your experience level is five or greater, the
longsword dipped is not an artifact, and Excalibur does not yet exist in your
dungeon, then you have a one out of six chance of gaining Excalibur.  "A
murky hand from the depths reaches up to bless the sword.  As the hand
retreats, the fountain disappears."

Otherwise the following effects can occur:

Hit Probability:

Computing your probability to hit a monster involves many variables, and is
quite a complicated procedure (which is why the computer does it so much
better).  However, here is an outline of how you can figure out your
probability of hitting a given monster with a given weapon...

First of all, compute your chance to hit by using the following formula:

       character luck
     + character level
     + monster AC             (see MONSTER INFORMATION section)
     + dexterity bonus        (see chart)
     + strength bonus         (see chart)
     + level bonus            (see chart)
     + special bonuses        (see chart)
     + to hit modifier        (see chart)
     + weapon enchantment     (see explanation)
     + relative hit bonus          (see explanation)
     - weight modifier        (see formula)
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
       chance to hit

The chance to hit is out of twenty.  Thus, to determine your percentage
chance of hitting, use the following formula:

     percent chance to hit = 100 * (chance to hit) / 20

------------------------------------------------------------

Weapon enchantment:  This is whatever the "plus" on the weapon is.  For
instance, if it's a +3 crysknife, add +3 for the weapon enchantment.

Relative hit bonus:  The relative hit bonus is only figured in for artifacts
(named weapons).  See the section on ARTIFACTS to look up the relative hit
bonus on a named weapon.

Weight modifier: the weight modifier is computed as follows (to determine
carrying capacity, see the section on CARRYING CAPACITY, and to determine
weight you are carrying, total the weights of all items in your inventory):
     (weight you are carrying - carrying capacity + 40) / 20

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kicking:

Kicking is one of the more useful functions in nethack.  Basically, you can
kick any creature or object within the game.  You cannot, however kick
anything if you are polymorphed into a monster with no legs (a snake, for
instance) or a monster that is too small, if your legs are wounded, if your
load is too heavy, or if you are stuck in a pit or bear trap.  The effects of
kicking certain things are listed below (although be careful - kicking things
can make a lot of noise and wake up monsters on the level):

Altars - kicking an altar is, in general, a bad idea.  Deities can do all
sorts of nasty things to you if you get them pissed off.

Doors - if a door is locked and you don't have a lock-pick, one way to get
through the door is to kick it down.  Watch out for lost hit points and
wounded legs if you do this, though.  Similarly, it is possible to kick down
a secret door, even if you haven't found it.  So... if you're pretty sure
there's a secret door there, and you haven't found it after the last five
searches, you might want to try kicking it a bit.

Chests - it is possible to break the lock on a locked chest by kicking it. Of
course, it is also possible to lose hit points and damage your legs by doing
so, so be careful to keep on eye out when at lower experience levels.

Empty space - kicking at empty space isn't terribly smart.  Although you
probably will get away with it, you do have a chance of straining a muscle,
which wounds your right leg.

Monsters - in general, when you kick a monster you will damage it.  Kicking a
monster is a good alternative if you have no weapon.  It is also a good
alternative if you are confused, as you will not then randomly wander around
if you miss the monster aimed at.  There are however a few exceptions to the
rule with kicking monsters...  notably, kicking dragons and other thick-
skinned creatures will do no damage.

Objects - in general, when you kick an object, it will move in the direction
in which you kick it.  The distance it moves will depend on your strength and
the weight of the object.  Fragile objects are not good to kick.  For
instance, kicking an egg will cause it to go splat, and kicking a potion will
generally break it.  Of course, this can be a way of identifying potions, as
you will then get the vapor effect if the potion has any.

Sinks - kicking a sink will produce various effects.  75% of the time, you
will merely get the message "Klunk!  The pipes vibrate noisily." (or just
"Klunk!" if you're blind).  Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance of having a
black pudding ooze up from the drain and attack you (assuming they haven't
been genocided yet).  If this doesn't happen, you have a 1/3 chance of "the
dish washer" returning.  It just so happens that the dish washer is a
succubus/incubus, however, so you might want to watch out for this.  Assuming
that doesn't happen, you've got a 1/3 chance that a ring (only one per sink)
will pop up from the drain in a bunch of muddy waste.

Thrones - kicking a throne can have several effects.  If your luck is
negative, you will always end up destroying the throne and finding several
gold pieces in the rubble (probably after a few sore toes, however).  If your
luck is positive, you have a chance of kicking loose some ornamental coins
and gems instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luck:

Your luck begins at 0, (+/-1 depending on the moon), and can range from -10
to +10.  When modified, it will decrease or increase (time-out) by 1 toward
its starting value every 600 moves (300 for angry gods) unless you're
carrying a luckstone (see TOOLS for more information about luckstones).
While carrying a luckstone it is still possible to change your luck.

Increasing Luck

1. Throw a gem at a unicorn.
     +5 luck if the jewel is identified and the unicorn is co-aligned.
     +1 luck if the jewel is unidentified.
     -3 to +3 luck if the jewel is identified and the unicorn is non-co-
     aligned.
2. Sacrifice on a co-aligned altar.
     +0 to +5 luck if the sacrifice is accepted, depending on monster
     difficulty factor.  Seeing a four-leaf clover is a sign that your luck
     has improved.
     =0 if your luck is negative luck your god is not angry.
     +1 luck if your luck is negative and your god is angry.
3. Sacrifice on a non-co-aligned altar.
     +1 if your luck is negative, the sacrifice is accepted and your god is
     not angry.  Chance of success is (3 + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level)
4. Sacrificing a human corpse at a chaotic altar.
     +2 luck if you are chaotic too.
5. Sitting on a throne.
     +1 luck if your luck is negative (sometimes).
6. Prayer.
     =0 if your luck is negative and your god is not angry (small chance)

Decreasing Luck

1. Killing a co-aligned unicorn.
     -5 luck no matter what.
2. Sacrificing a human.
     -5 luck if you are non-chaotic.
3. After converting to a new god, trying to sacrifice at the altar of your
     original god.  Conversion is accomplished by sacrificing at a non-co-
     aligned altar while your god is angry.
     -5 luck no matter what.
4. Converting to a new god.
     -3 luck always.
5. Praying before your between prayer time-out expires.
     -3 luck.  Moral: don't pray too often.
6. Breaking a mirror.
     -2 luck. (It figures, doesn't it?)
7. Killing a friendly human.
     -2 luck always.
8. Killing a pet (or other tame monster).
     -1 luck each time.
9. Desecrating (kicking or digging) a co-aligned altar.
     -1 luck (Ouch!)
10. Killing a peaceful monster.
     -1 luck (50% chance).
11. Sacrifice at a non-co-aligned altar.
     -1 luck if you fail and your god is not angry.  Chance of success is (3
     + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level).
12. Hitting a blind monster.
     -1 luck (0.2% chance).

Robbing shops does not lower your luck.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic:

Many people have asked for a section which details information about how the
reading of spellbooks and casting of spells works.  Well, here it is!

Memorizing spellbooks:  If the spellbook is cursed, it will be impossible to
memorize under any conditions.  Otherwise, the following test must be passed
in order to successfully memorize a spellbook:

       (your intelligence + 4)
     + (your experience level / 2)
     - (2 * the spell level of the spellbook)
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Must be greater than a randomly generated number from 0 to 20.

The possible effects from failing to memorize a spellbook are as follows
(chances of each effect are equal):

1. Your character is teleported.
     "You feel a wrenching sensation."
2. Your character gains the aggravate monster intrinsic.
     "You feel threatened."
3. You are blinded for 250 to 349 turns.
4. You lose all of your gold.
     "You realize that you have no gold."
5. You become confused for 16 to 22 turns.
     "These runes were just to much to comprehend."
6. Poison!  Gloves, if being worn, are corroded (assuming they're not
     rustproof) by 1 (i.e. +2 gloves become +1, +0 gloves become -1.  -2 is
     the worst your gloves will corrode to).  If you are poison resistant,
     you will lose 2 points of strength and 1 to 6 hit points.  Otherwise,
     you will lose 3 to 6 points of strength and 1 to 10 hit points.
     "The book was coated with contact poison!"
7. The book explodes, doing 7 to 25 points of damage.  If you are magic
     resistant, no damage ensues.
     "As you read the book, it explodes in your face."

When a spellbook is successfully memorized, it is placed in the list of
spells that you know.  You will then be able to use that spell (i.e. cast or
attempt to cast it) from 2 to (10 - the spell level) times before you will
need to "re-memorize" the spell by reading another spellbook of that type.

Casting memorized spells:  Attempts to cast a spell while you are confused
will always fail.  Otherwise, in order to successfully cast a spell, the
following test must be passed:

       your intelligence
     + your luck
     - (3 * the level of the spell)
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Must be greater than or equal to 0.

If a spell is successfully cast, the appropriate effects take place and a
number of energy points equal to the level of the spell is removed from your
current EP.

If the spell is failed, a number of energy points equal to the level of the
spell is still removed from your current EP, and the following message is
given:
     "The air around you crackles as you goof up." or
     "Far out... a light show!" (if you are hallucinating)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pets:

Pets are one of the most useful things in the dungeons and so should be
treated as such.  Here are a few useful hints regarding pets:

They will eat only what they need in order to survive and will leave food
rations alone unless they are very hungry or you throw them one.

Pets will become violent if they are too hungry, or if you leave them on a
level, go down the stairs and them come back later.

You can actually chat with your pets to gain knowledge about how hungry they
are.

"You feel worried about your [pet]" means that your pet is starving. "You
have a sad feeling for a moment" means that your pet has snuffed it. "You
hear noises in the distance" means that your pet is in battle.

Kittens change into housecats and then large cats, whereas little dogs become
dogs, and then large dogs.

Watch out when you are confused, blind, etc.  You do not want to accidentally
kill your pet.

The minute you eat a dog or cat, every non-tame, non-peaceful monster that is
on the level will head for you with blood in its eye(s).  That is, you gain
an intrinsic:  Aggravate monster

What monsters your pets will attack is directly dependent on the level of the
pet and the level of the monster.  Pets will not attack monsters more
powerful than them.  The one exception is if you have on a ring of conflict.
If so, your pets will attack anything.  (Ever seen a minotaur make doggie
pancake? Moral: keep your ring of conflict off if you're near a big nasty.)

If you think your pet is a bit wimpy, use a wand of polymorph on him.  If
this makes him wimpier, don't blame us - try again!

A scroll of taming can create more pets for you, but having devils as pets
can be a minor problem (although not as much of a problem in current
versions).

If you meet a wild pet, the best bet is to throw food at it - anything you
could eat.  Tripe is wonderful, but don't bother throwing rotted corpses.

You can even tame pets with names given by other people, i.e. bones levels.

A leash will allow you to keep the animal with you at all times (even if you
get teleported or go through a trap door), but also tends to make him get in
your way more often.

A whistle will attract your pet to you when applied.  Even better, a magic
whistle will teleport your pet to your side when applied.  Very useful when
going up or down levels with your pet.

Pets will not pick up cursed objects or even cross over them, which will help
you to avoid these items.  However, keep in mind that you may have to clear
cursed items from halls if you want your pet to follow you, and that if you
throw a food item (especially tripe) on a cursed item, your pet will be
trained to step on cursed items in the future.  A warning: dead-end corridors
can be very bad if there is a cursed item in the exit and the pet is between
you and the cursed item (this can happen if your pet kills a creature that
was carrying a cursed item).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Praying:

Praying can get you out of a lot of jams in the game of nethack, if your god
is pleased with you.  On the other hand, if the gods are angry at you, you
can get into an awful lot of trouble.

If your deity is pleased with you, chances are that your worst problem will
be fixed, although all of your problems could be fixed, or none of them might
be fixed (this is dependent on your luck).  The following are problems that
your deity might fix, from worst (in the deity's eyes, not necessarily
yours!) to least:

1. You are turning to stone.
2. You are being strangled (by an amulet of strangulation).
3. You are sick.
4. You are starving.
5. Your hp are below 5, or your hp are below 1/7 of max.
6. You have lycanthropy.
7. You are stuck in a wall.
8. You are wearing a cursed item which levitates you.
9. You are wearing a cursed blindfold.
10. You are being punished.
11. You have a cursed loadstone or cursed luckstone.
12. You are wielding/wearing a cursed weapon/armor.
13. You are blind.
14. You are hungry.
15. You are poisoned.
16. You have wounded legs.
17. You are stunned.
18. You are confused.
19. You are hallucinating.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Removing Curses:

There are several ways to uncurse cursed items - and several other ways to
get rid of cursed items:

1. Dipping in fountains will eventually remove the curse from stuff - "The
     water glows for a moment" indicates that your item has been uncursed.
     You can dip items even if you are wearing them.

2. Reading a scroll of remove curse will remove the curse from stuff you are
     wearing.  If the scroll of remove curse is blessed, everything in your
     pack will be uncursed.

3. If you have good relations with your god, your god will uncurse things you
     are wearing, and occasionally will remove the curse from items in your
     pack.  This will happen when you pray.

4. Reading an uncursed scroll of enchant armor/weapon will remove the curse
     from the armor/weapon that gets enchanted.  Similarly, reading a blessed
     scroll of enchant armor/weapon will bless the armor/weapon that gets
     enchanted.

5. Dipping cursed items in holy water will uncurse them.

6. A wand of cancellation will remove the curse from all items in your pack
     if you zap yourself with it.  Note, however, that it will also remove
     all enchantments and names (i.e. Stormbringer) on all items in your
     pack.

7. Try having a monster steal your cursed items.  Nymphs will steal cursed
     armor and weapons.  Be sure that you have dropped everything else,
     however, before trying this.  Succubi/incubi will also remove cursed
     armor sometimes.

8. An uncursed or blessed scroll of destroy armor can be used to destroy
     cursed armor.  Be sure to take off all your other armor before reading
     the scroll.

9. Polymorphing yourself into a monster that can't wear armor or use a weapon
     will cause you to fall out of your armor (or it may destroy your armor
     altogether) and/or drop your weapon.

10. For those that enjoy risks, rarely, very rarely, a magic trap will inform
     you that 'You feel that someo

Robbing Shops:

Here we have outlined a few of the standard ways of robbing a shop.  Some of
them let you get away with it scott-free.  Others will send the keystone kops
after you.  Some will even allow you to keep robbing the shop and selling the
stuff back to the shopkeeper until you have all his money!  Experiment with
these and have fun!

For reference, in all the diagrams:
     @ = shopkeeper
     X = you (for clarity)
     f = cat (or whatever pet you may have)
     P = pile of goodies (also for clarity)
     K = Keystone Kops (after you robbed the shop)

Method One:  Pile everything in the shop up and teleport it out with a wand
of teleport.  This scatters the items on the level for you to find.

     Enter the shop...   Make a pile...      Poof!
     -------------       -------------       -------------
     |!!$%%[))...|#      |...........|#      |.........@.|#
     |$+$$(![[.@.X#      |P....f....@-#      |...........-#
     |+$%]**!$...|f###   |.X.........|####   |.X...f.....|####
     -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Two:  Dig a hole in the wall with a wand of digging or any other handy
method of digging, and then kick the stuff out.  Two notes, here:  1) kicking
potions, eggs, or other fragile items will destroy them.  2) You cannot just
kick an item out of the shop - if you do so, the shopkeeper will charge you
for it.  You have to be outside the shop (i.e., in the wall) while you're
kicking it out of the shop.

     Get positioned...   Dig...   #          Make a pile...
     -------------       ----------.--       ----------X--
     |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!.f......P|#
     |$+$$(![[.@.-#      |$+$$(![[.@..f      |.....!....@.#

     |.....!....@P#      |.....!.....X#
     |......!f...|####   |......!..@.|####
     -------------       -------------

Method Three:  Dig a hole in the wall of the shop.  Then dig a hole just
outside of the shop (by specifying '>' for the digging direction), falling
through to the next level.  Trek back up to the shop, grab everything you can
carry, walk out of the shop, onto the hole, and hey presto!  You're on the
next level with all the loot, and the Keystone Kops and shopkeeper are still
back on the previous level.  If you don't fall through the trapdoor, don't
worry - just hit '>' to go down through the hole you made.

      X Dig out...        ^ Make a pit...     ^ Grab stuff...

     |..........@-#      |.K...KK..K.-#
     |...........|####   |..KK...K...|####
     -------------       -------------

Method Four:  Polymorph the shopkeeper into something easier to handle (with
a wand of polymorph) and then kill him/her.  Of course, once the shopkeeper's
gone, you can take what you like, including his or her gold!

     Enter the shop...   Polymorph...        Kill shopkeeper!
     -------------       -------------       -------------
     |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!$%%[))f..|#      |!!$%%[)f...|#

     |+$%]**!$...|f###   |+$%]**!$.X.|####   |+$%]**!$.X.|####
     -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Five:  If you do not happen to have any props (wands, etc), and have a
ration (especially tripe) or two, then this method is for you.  It is also
the most common:  train your pet.  Basically, if your pet drops an item right
in front of the door to the shop, you can pick it up for free.  Throw him
food, and he'll keep on doing it!

                                             Throw pet food and
     Let pet in shop...  It brings item...   take item - it is free!

     |+$%]**!$(.@|###    |+$%]**!$(.@|###    |+$%]**!$(f@|###
     -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Six:  Teleport out.  Grab everything in the shop and then teleport the
heck out of there.  This is especially effective if you have teleport control
and know where the stairway is.  It's even better if you have your pet on a
leash, or a magic whistle, so you don't have to worry about leaving your pet
behind.  But note - the Kops and the shopkeeper will be after you.

     Enter the shop...   Grab everything...  Poof!
     -------------       -------------       -------------
     |!!$%%[))...|#      |...........|#      |..K....K.@.|#

     |+$%]**!$...|f###   |.X.........|####   |.....f..KK.|####
     -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Seven:  Push a boulder into the shop, then use the boulder to block
the door. Once the door is blocked, rip off everything in the shop and then
teleport out.  Although the Kops will be after you, you won't have to deal
with a pissed off shopkeeper.

     Push in a rock...   Keep on going...    Push it back...

Sink Effects:

There are basically three things that you can do with a sink.  You can kick
it (which is detailed under KICKING), you can quaff from it, or you can drop
a ring down it.

Survival:

If you are low on hit points, or are worried about the zoo that you just
stumbled across while blind and confused, there are two primary methods to
survive beyond running away:  engraving Elbereth and a scroll of scare
monster.  As an interesting note, if you happen to get the message "This
water gives you bad breath," you will scare monsters near you away (due to
your awful halitosis).

Engraving Elbereth

If you engrave "Elbereth" in the dust and keep standing on it, most monsters
will not attack you.  Note that humans, elves, soldiers, shopkeeper, etc. (in
short, all @'s) will not regard Elbereth, and other monsters may throw things
at you.  Dragons can also still use their breath weapons against you.  If you
swing at them or throw things at them you will scuff out the engraving,
allowing them to attack.  Also, in most cases the writing will eventually
fade out.  How long it takes to fade or scuff is dependent on what you used
to engrave.  Your fingers will do, but not for long.  A weapon is really
good, but you tend to dull blades that way ( athames will not dull from
engraving). Some wands, magic markers, and other objects can also be used to
engrave, although it will take a charge to do so (wands of fire or digging
are excellent for engraving, for instance).  The trick here is to levitate,
which will prevent you from scuffing the writing.

Scare monster

Monsters (this does not include humans) will not cross a scroll of scare
monster.  Thus, you can stand on it, and they will not attack you (similar to
Elbereth), or you could drop it in a doorway, and the monsters would not come
through (good way to cork the bottleneck of a zoo).

Every time you drop/pick up a scroll of scare monster it moves toward a
cursed state.  Drop a blessed scroll, pick it up it is uncursed.  Drop that
uncursed scroll, pick it up it is cursed.  Drop that cursed scroll, pick it
up it turns to dust.  (Incidentally, placing a scroll of scare monster in a
chest and then picking it up later will not change its status.)  Thus, if you
pick up a scroll that turns to dust, it is a worn out scare monster scroll.
One neat trick is to keep blessing the scroll after you use it, so that you
can use it over and over again.

Note:  Minotaurs are the exception to the rule.  Standing on a scroll of
scare monster or engraved Elbereth does nothing to stop them from attacking
you.

Throne Effects:

When you sit upon a throne, you have a one in six chance of having some
effect take place (no effect = "You feel out of place...").  The effects
which can take place are as follows (equal chances):

1. You lose 3-6 points from a random attribute, and lose 1-10 hp.
2. One point is added to random attribute.
3. You lose 1-6 hp if shock resistant.  Otherwise you lose 1-30 hp.
     "A [massive] charge of electricity shoots through your body!"
4. If your hit points are within 5 of max, add 4 to your max.  Your hit
     points are raised to max, and blindness, sickness, and bad legs will all
     be healed.
     "You feel much, much better!"
5. You will lose all of your gold.
     "You notice you have no gold."
     "You feel a strange sensation."  (if you have no gold)
6. If your luck + random of [0-4] is less than 0, your luck will increase by
     one.  Otherise, you can wish for an item.
     "You feel your luck is changing."
7. This one's rather obvious:  lots of nasties will get summoned.
     "You hear a voice echo:  'Thy audience has been summoned, Sire!'"
8. You will be given the boon of genociding one creature.
     "You hear a voice echo:  'By thy imperious order, Sire!'"
9. If your luck is greater than zero, you will be blinded for 250-349 turns.
     Otherwise a random item you possess will be cursed.
     "You hear a voice echo:  'A curse upon thee for sitting upon this most
     holy throne.'"
10. If your luck is less than zero or you have the intrinsic see invisible,
     the level will be magically mapped for you.  Otherwise, you will gain
     the intrinsic of see invisible.
     "An image forms in your mind."
     "Your vision clarifies."
11. If your luck is less than zero, you will gain the intrinsic of aggravate
     monsters.  Otherwise, you will be randomly teleported on the level.
     "You feel threatened."
     "You feel a wrenching sensation."
12. One or more items in your pack will be identified.
     "You are granted a gift of insight."
13. You will become confused for 16 to 22 turns.
     "Your mind turns into a pretzel."

Unicorn Horns:

When a)pplied, an uncursed or blessed unicorn horn can do any or all of the
following:  cure blindness, stop confusion, stop hallucination, cure
sickness, stop stunning, or restore ability.  Note that if the unicorn horn
is cursed, these effects will be reversed.

You can #d)ip a unicorn horn in a potion, and if the potion is a potion of
confusion, hallucination, or sickness, the potion will become a potion of
water.  If it says, "Interesting," the potion is of another type.

Unicorn horns will not rust, and they enchant well, so they make ideal
weapons, especially against rust monsters, acid blobs, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wishes:

There are five ways to get wishes.  These are:

1. A wand of wishing  (Note for poly-pilers here:  It is no longer possible
     to polymorph another wand into a wand of wishing.)
2. A magic lamp - djinni appears and is grateful for his release (Also no
     longer possible to create via a polymorph.)
3. A fountain - water demon appears and is sometimes grateful for his release
     (see FOUNTAIN EFFECTS for more information).
4. Occasionally, a glowing potion will have a djinni in it who is grateful
     for his release.
5. Sitting on a throne can occasionally give you a wish.  (See THRONE
     EFFECTS)

To wish effectively, you should wish for an item (or items) that can
(literally) be placed in your inventory.  You could wish for a "wide sword"
and get one.  Better yet, you could wish for a "+3 wide sword" and you would
at least get a wide sword.  Whether you get the asked for enchantments
depends on a random factor.  You may wish for an enchantment as high as you
want, but your chances of getting it go exponentially downwards after +3, and
to zero after +5.  Thus, you're better off wishing for "+2 gray dragon scale
mail" than let's say "blessed +4 gray dragon scale mail."  In either case you
would get at least +0 gray dragon scale mail (although it might be cursed).
If the item is one that often comes in multiples (scrolls or potions, for
example) instead of having an enchantment, you can wish for several (i.e. 3
scrolls) and have a good chance of getting them.  The exceptions to this rule
are gold, which you can wish for a lot of, and rocks, which you can wish for
as many as you like.

The general modifiers to use when wishing are, of course, "blessed,"
"uncursed," and "cursed."  A specific modifier for small missile weapons is
"poisoned" (as it appears in your inventory).  Also there are named weapons
(artifacts), as in a "blessed +3 wide sword named Stormbringer."

Here's a few useful items and the exact wording you need to use to get them:

     "blessed +3 war hammer named Mjollnir"
     "blessed +3 broadsword named Stormbringer"
     "blessed +3 katana named Snickersnee"
     "blessed +3 long sword named Excalibur"
     "blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail"
     "blessed +3 helm of telepathy"
     "blessed +3 pair of speed boots"
     "blessed +3 gauntlets of power"
     "blessed +3 shield of reflection"
     "blessed +3 cloak of displacement"
     "blessed +3 Hawaiian shirt"
     "blessed amulet of life saving"
     "3 blessed potions of gain ability"
     "3 blessed scrolls of genocide"
     "3 cursed scrolls of genocide" (caution is advised)
     "blessed spellbook of identify" (you never get more than one spellbook)
     "blessed ring of levitation"
     "wand of polymorph"
     "blessed tinning kit" (makes blessed tins)
     "figurine of a gray dragon" (for that pet gray dragon you always wanted)

Amulets:

Note:  for all item lists, the "Prob" column lists the relative probability
of that particular item being randomly generated (when a level is created, a
monster is killed, an item is polymorphed, etc.).

  Name                      Effect                  Prob Weight

| Amulet of Yendor        | -----                  |   0 | 0 |
--------------------------------------------------------------

Amulet of esp - gives intrinsic telepathy.
Amulet of life saving - will save your life once.  After you die it brings
     you back up to max hp.  Note that if you choke on something while
     wearing one of these, you're liable to keep right on eating and choke
     again.  Also, this won't save you if you genocide whatever you are.
Amulet of Yendor - no effect from wearing.  When in your possession prevents
     level teleport, often prevents normal teleports, randomly maps out
     blocks of level around you, and causes spell casting to take more
     energy.
Amulet of restful sleep - waits many turns, and then causes you to go to
     sleep (against your will).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying Amulets:

Identifying amulets is a process of elimination, starting with determining
whether or not the amulet is cursed.  Determining whether it's cursed is easy
enough if you're a priest or have a pet on hand.  If the amulet is cursed,
don't wear it - there are too many nasty things cursed amulets can do.  If
the amulet isn't cursed, it's probably either an amulet of esp, life saving,
reflection, or versus poison.  However, watch out - amulets of change often
aren't cursed.  So, if you don't mind risking the possibility of changing
sexes (and character name), try it on and see what it does.  To see if it's
an amulet of esp, get blinded (put on a blindfold, quaff a potion of
blindness, etc.).  If you can suddenly see all the monsters on the level,
that's what it is.  Next, find a room away from all the monsters, and zap a
wand at the wall so that it bounces at you (do this with a wand that you're
immune to, or something non-harmful like a sleep ray).  If your medallion
reflects the ray, it's an amulet of reflection.  Finally, try eating
something poisonous.  If it doesn't do you any harm, it's vs. poison.  If
none of these are the case, you know it's an amulet of life saving - one of
the most valuable items in the game.

Armor Effects:

Cloak of displacement - displaces you, causing first hit against you by a
     monster to miss and other hits to be at a severe disadvantage.
Cloak of invisibility - makes you invisible.
Cloak of magic resistance - gives you resistance against magic, such that
     certain spells won't work against you and magic based traps like
     teleport and polymorph traps won't have any effect on you.
Cloak of protection - makes your AC better.
Dragon scale mail - depending upon the type of dragon scale mail (red, gray,
     etc.) it will give you a different immunity.  See FOOD - CORPSES for
     information about what immunity each dragon type provides.
Elven boots - gives you stealth (i.e. if you walk into a room, a monster that
Elven cloak - gives you stealth.
Fumble boots - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall occasionally,
     etc.  Tends to be cursed.
Gauntlets of dexterity - increases your dexterity by the defense bonus.
Gauntlets of fumbling - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall
     occasionally, etc.  Tends to be cursed.
Gauntlets of power - increases your strength to 25.
Helm of brilliance - adds bonus to your intelligence and wisdom (i.e. a +1
     helm will add one point to each).
Helm of opposite alignment - changes your alignment to opposite, or if
     neutral to random alignment. It can be removed to return to the original
     alignment.
Helm of telepathy - gives you telepathy, as the intrinsic, but you don't have
     to be blind to use it.  When not blind, only gives telepathy in
     vicinity, not for the entire screen.
Jumping boots - allows you to jump up to two squares away.
Levitation boots - causes you to levitate.  (Nasty if cursed)
Shield of reflection - ray attacks (like lightning, fire, gas) are reflected,
     and also prevents gaze attacks where the monster gazes at you.  Note
     that this will not help if you look at the monster (i.e. the medusa).
     Especially useful against dragons and floating eyes.
Speed boots - doubles your speed.  Allows you to have more attacks and be
     able to run away better.
Water walking boots - allows you to safely walk on water.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying Armor:

Identifying armor is usually pretty simple.  First, make sure the armor isn't
cursed (again, simple enough if you're a priest of have a pet on hand).
Then, simply try it on.  Any bonuses will immediately be identified for you.
Certain items will also do other things, as listed above, and these effects
will show up immediately.  The only two types of armor that are somewhat
difficult to identify are water walking boots and jumping boots.  Jumping
boots can be identified by trying to #jump once you've put them on.  If you
can jump, that's what they are.  Water walking boots are only positively
identifiable (short of a scroll of identify or equivalent) by taking a step
of faith and trying to tread on the wet stuff.

Food - Corpses:

Eating certain dead monsters (monster corpses) can confer intrinsics or have
other effects.  Generally intrinsics are conferred by eating a monster with
that intrinsic, although certain individual monsters or monster types can
also confer intrinsics or have other effects.

If you eat a monster with one of the following intrinsics, you will have a
chance of gaining that intrinsic yourself.  The major exception in all cases
are baby dragon corpses, which can never confer intrinsics (so as to prevent
polymorph abuse via laying of eggs).  Note also that each monster corpse may
only confer one of these intrinsics, and they are tested for in the order in
which they are listed.

Identifying Potions:

There are several ways of identifying potions, mostly based upon the messages
listed above.  If you quaff a potion, you should be able to tell what it was
from the info in the quaffing section.  Throwing a potion at a monster will
often tell you what it was from the effects on that monster (especially if
you have a stethescope to examine it with).  Finally, potions can often be
identified by breaking them and observing the vapor effect.  Set the potion
down and kick it until it smashes.  Then pay close attention to what happens.
Oh, and remember - when that red dragon breathes fire at you and your potion
boils and explodes, all is not lost.  You still get the vapor effect, so you
can figure out what the next one like that will do.

Ring Effects:

Note that all rings except +0 rings increase your food consumptions to
varying degrees.

     the wand and freezing spheres.
Conflict - Causes monsters to attack each other instead of you if they are
     next to each other.
Fire resistance - You become invulnerable to fire, including backblasts from
     the wand and (red) dragon's breath.
Gain strength - Increments (or decrements if cursed) your strength by the
     appropriate amount.
Increase damage - Increases the damage you do to monsters when hitting them.
Poison resistance - You are invulnerable to poison (including poisonous
     corpses, but not rotted ones, and all poison stings, bites, and
     potions).
Polymorph - Will occasionally cause you to randomly polymorph into another
     creature.
Polymorph control - Allows you to choose what monster you turn into if you
     get polymorphed.
Protection - Increases your armor class and (probably) your saving throws by
     the appropriate amount.  (Or decreases if cursed.)
Protection from shape changers - Forces chameleons and other shape changers
     to take on their true form.
Regeneration - Replenishes HP at about 1 a move, but increases food
     consumption a lot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying Rings:

To figure out what a ring is, again start by figuring out if the ring is
cursed or not.  If the ring is cursed, don't throw it away!  It's a prime
candidate for identification through the first method:  chuck it down a sink,
and see what happens.  See the SINK EFFECTS section for more information
about what happens when various ring types are thrown down a sink.  If the
ring isn't cursed, it probably is somewhat beneficial.  Try it on.  If
something happens immediately, you'll know what it is (levitation, for
example).  Some rings can only be identified after being worn for a while -
for example, a ring of polymorph will only polymorph you every once in a
while, and a ring of teleport also only works now and then.  Other rings can
only be guessed at -for instance, if you suddenly can find secret doors
easier than you have been, it might be a ring of searching.  If you suddenly
are killing monsters more easily, it might be a ring of increase damage.

* Determining your chances for successfully enchanting armor is fairly
simple. Your chance for succeeding (and not causing the item to disintegrate
due to over enchantment) is totally dependent upon the current bonus of the
item.  If the current bonus is three or less (five or less for elven mithril
coats), you will always succeed.  Otherwise, you have one chance out of
whatever the current bonus of the item is.  In other words, if the bonus is
+4, you have a 1/4 or 25% chance of being successful.  If the bonus is +8,
you have a 1/8 or 12.5% chance of being successful.  Thus, it is
theoretically possible to enchant armor up to +maxint, but the laws of
probability would not favor it!

** Chances for successfully enchanting weapons are far easier.  Basically,
you will always succeed if the weapon is at +5 or less.  Once you're over
that, you have a 2/3 chance of being successful each time, regardless of the
bonus.

Identifying Scrolls:

Unfortunately, there aren't any easy ways to figure out what a scroll is.
Short of using and identify scroll (or equivalent) or actually reading it,
you can't tell what a scroll is.

Tool Effects:

Bag of holding - will hold many items, only adding part of their weight to
     your total pack weight.  Blessing and cursing of bags of holding does
     not currently work correctly.  Also, do not put a bag of holding, a bag
     of tricks, or a wand of cancellation into a bag of holding.  Both items
     and contents will blow up.
Bag of tricks - will allow you to create a monster whenever you activate it.
Blindfold - makes you blind.  Useful when you have telepathy.
Bugle - will awaken soldiers on level.  Useful for getting into castle.
Chest - holds things, but is very heavy.
Credit card - can be used to open locked doors.
Crystal ball - can be used to detect things on level.
Drum - awakens monsters; may scare them away.
Drum of earthquake - will initiate an earthquake whose intensity depends on
     player level.  That is, it creates random pits.
Expensive camera - can be flashed at monsters to blind them.  Can also blind
     self (useful if you don't have a blindfold).
Figurine - when activated will provide a tame pet of the same type as the
     figurine.
Fire horn - when played will act as a wand of fire; a ray of flame shoots out
     in desired direction.
Flute - may calm snakes if player has enough dexterity.  Can also be used to
     get into the castle.
Frost horn - when played will act as a wand of cold; a ray of cold shoots out
     in desired direction.
Harp - may calm nymph if player has enough dexterity.  Can also be used to
Horn - will awaken monsters; range depends on player level.  May also scare
     monsters.
Ice box - will prevent monster corpses from spoiling if they are promptly
     placed within the ice box.
Key - differently shaped keys will open differently shaped locks.
Lamp - will light up a room when activated.
Large box - holds things, but is very heavy.
Leash - will keep your pet with you, even if you fall through a trapdoor,
     teleport, etc.  However, your pet tends to get in your way more.
Lock pick - used to open locked doors and chests.
Magic flute - may put monsters to sleep; area of effect depends on player
     level.
Magic harp - charms monsters; area of effect depends on player level.
Magic lamp - if rubbed, a djinni will appear.  Djinnis from blessed lamps
     will always give wishes; from normal lamps may give a wish (random);
     from cursed lamps they will never give a wish.  May be recharged once
     with a blessed scroll of charging.
Magic marker - useful for writing graffiti on dungeon floors.  Also can be
     used to write spells on blank scrolls.
Magic whistle - will teleport all of your pets on the level to the same room
     as you.
Mirror - can scare some monsters.  Also useful for reflecting gaze attacks.
     Can be used in conjunction with blindfold to determine relative position
     of medusa or Wizard of Yendor.
Pick-axe - can be used to dig through walls.  Also useful as a weapon.
Sack - will hold items, freeing inventory space.
Skeleton key - will open any locked door or chest.
Stethescope - will tell you stats on creature applied to (HP, level, AC,
     gold, etc.).
Tinning kit - allows you to tin monster corpses to take with you.  Heavy.
Tin opener - allows you to open tins easier.
Whistle - when blown, your pets will start heading in your direction.  Other
     monsters may do likewise, though.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying Tools:

Once again, make sure that the item is not cursed before playing around with
it.  Most tools are fairly obvious as to their function.  For instance, a
blindfold is always a blindfold, with no other magical properties.  Certain
items (horns, for instance) will have more than one type that appear the same
though.  Here's how you can figure out what they are:

Bags - first of all, drop the bag on the ground and #loot it.  If you feel
something furry, it's a bag of tricks.  Otherwise, load up until you can't
carry anything more.  Then dump some stuff into the bag (by applying it).  If
you can then pick up more, it's a bag of holding.

Drums - activate the drum.  If it's a drum of earthquake, you'll know it
immediately from the pits opening up around you.

Flutes - try playing the flute when you have several monsters around you.  If
they go to sleep, it's a magical flute.

Harps - try playing the harp when you have several monsters around you.  If
they become charmed (tame), you have a magic harp.

Horns - activate the horn, tell it to improvise, and give it a direction (if
it asks).  You'll immediately notice the effect if it's magical.

Keys - try a key on various locks.  If it appears to open all of them, it's
probably a skeleton key.  (Note, however, that a credit card works just as
well, and is lighter.)

Lamps - try activating the lamp.  If it has no oil, it's a magic lamp.

Whistles - try blowing it.  If it produces a high whistle, it's normal.  A
wierd whistling will be a magic whistle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying Wands:

When identifying a wand, I generally start by engraving anything (usually I
use 'xxxxx') on a spot with my fingers (use the '-' key when asked what to
engrave with).  Next, I try to engrave with the wand.  The reason that I
engrave something else first is simple:  a wand of polymorph will change the
writing to something else, thus identifying it.  Also, a wand of cancellation
or make invisible will make any writing already on the spot disappear.  A
wand of teleport will teleport the writing to another spot on the level.
Barring these four wand types, many wands will be either be immediately
identified upon trying to engrave (for instance, a wand of light will light
up the room or a wand wishing will give you a wish), and failing that, you
can often figure out what the wand is based upon the message that you're
given (see WAND EFFECTS above for effects that occur when engraving).

If engraving doesn't identify the wand, find a handy monster to zap the wand
at (not your pet - they're not invincible).  Make sure you're standing on a
diagonal from the monster, so the wand won't bounce back at you.  Now, zap
the wand and see what happens.  You'll often be able to immediately figure
out what happened.  (A brief note here:  be careful not to mistake make

invisible for teleport - just because the monster disappears doesn't mean
it's not still there!)

If you still can't figure out what it is, try zapping it when you're near
where you think a secret door is (to check for secret door detection) if it's
non-directional, or zap it at a doorway (to check for opening or locking) if
it's directional.

Failing all of these tests usually means it's a wand of nothing.

Artifacts:

Artifacts, also known as named weapons, are the most powerful weapons in the
game.  They can be wished for, granted by your god, and some of them can
a longsword in a fountain (see FOUNTAIN EFFECTS), and Sting or Orcrist can be
obtained by naming the appropriate weapons.  Polymorphing a regular weapon
into an artifact is no longer possible.

Artifacts may also have special features.  These special features are
explained below.  Finally, all artifacts have an alignment.  This affects
your chances of getting a given weapon from your deity (i.e. a lawful god
will not bestow a neutral weapon).

Certain weapons will have a monster listed under the what column.  If so, the
artifact's bonuses are only gained against that type of monster.  Against
other creatures the artifact fights as a regular weapon of its type.

For more information on how to compute hit probabilities, how much damage an
artifact does, and what the relative hit and damage bonuses are, see the
sections on HIT PROBABILITY and DAMAGE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the special abilities:

cold - The extra damage done is cold damage, and as a result will not affect
     cold resistant creatures.
defend - This will defend you against whatever special attack type the
     artifact has.  Excalibur and Stormbringer defend against level draining
     attacks (even though Excalibur can't drain levels itself), Frost brand
     defends against cold cold based attacks (i.e. gives cold resistance),
     and Fire brand defends against fire based attacks (i.e. gives fire
     resistance).
drain level - This will drain a level from the creature attacking,
     effectively making it less powerful as well as removing eight hp from
     it.
fire - The extra damage done is fire damage, and as a result will not affect
     fire resistant creatures.
search - Will aid you in searching, much as a ring of searching.
seek - This should (eventually) "aid you in seeking objects." Currently, this
     ability is unimplemented.
shock - The extra damage done is electrical damage, and as a result will not
     affect shock resistant creatures.
warn - Will warn you when more monsters more powerful than you are around,
     much as a ring of warning.

Also, note that Excalibur, if gained via dipping in a fountain or via
becoming the Hand of Elbereth, will be rust proof.  Stormbringer, if gained
via becoming the Hand of Elbereth will also be rust proof.  Stormbringer and
Excalibur, if gained via other means (including wishing), as well as all
other named weapons, are not rust proof unless they are rust proofed by a
player character (i.e. you rust proof it yourself or find it on a bones
level, and the previous owner had rust proofed it).

Nethack Abuse:

This section details several scenarios that most experienced players would
term "Nethack Abuse."  They generally involve characters with specific items
and specific methods for quickly going up levels or gaining many items.  For
previous versions of nethack this section would have been much larger, but
the dev team has (quite intelligently) removed many of the more blatant
methods of abuse (such as polypiling for wands of wishing).

Scenario 1:  Sinks can be a wonderful means to gain levels, items of all
sorts, and intrinsics.  This is all possible because a sink, when kicked,
will often disgorge a black pudding, and black puddings divide when attacked.
This means that with just a few extra props you can quickly gain all the
aforementioned items.  First of all, you'll need some way of protecting
yourself from the puddings.  This is best accomplished by a scroll of scare
monster or engraving Elbereth on the ground (either use something that will
make a permanent inscription or have a means of levitating over the
engraving, because you'll scuff it out otherwise).  Do this on a spot
adjacent to the sink.

Next, find a room with a sink in it.  You'll need to carefully prepare this
room for your upcoming fun.  Shut (and lock if possible) all the doors into
the room.  If any of the exits don't have doors, engrave Elbereth in the
doorway to prevent other monsters from bothering you.  Also, make sure your
pet is out of the room, and stays out (it'll probably get killed otherwise).
Try dropping something cursed in any open doorways.  That'll keep it out.

Now, go back to the spot that you've prepared next to the sink and kick the
sink until it disgorges a black pudding.  When the black pudding gets close,
hit it.  It'll probably divide.  Keep hitting the black puddings - you'll
often divide them, eventually kill them, and when you run out, kick the sink
a few more times until you get another one.  Eat the fresh black pudding
corpses to gain intrinsics, pick up the stuff that they leave lying around,
and soak up those experience points for killing them.

Of course, all of this is sweetened immensely if you happen to have an altar
nearby.  Keep sacrificing the black pudding corpses and you'll get all sorts
of wonderful things!

Scenario 2:  (This isn't really a major "abuse" type, as it does fall under
the planned scope of the game, but nevertheless...)  Ever found a wand of
polymorph and wondered what it's useful for?  Many people find one useful for
polymorphing ;pets into something nasty, or for polymorphing themselves and
hoping to turn into something powerful, but one thing that a lot of people
don't know is that you can aim a wand of polymorph at an item or pile of
items, or even up to five piles of items lined up in a row, and it will
polymorph every item in all the piles.  Thus, if you need a particular item,
this can be a way to get it - just create it yourself via polymorphing!

When polypiling (as the resident nethackers term it), it is important to
remember a few things.  First of all, all items will remain within the same
object class when polymorphed.  Thus, a weapon become a different weapon
after being polymorphed, a ring will become a ring, a scroll will become a
scroll, etc.  There are two exceptions to this rule.  The first is that a
unicorn horn or a worm tooth will become a weapon when polymorphed.  The
second is that a dragon corpse will become dragon scale mail of that type of
dragon when polymorphed.

The next thing to remember is that items will retain charges,
blessing/curses, bonuses, etc., when polymorphed.  Thus, a wand will still
have the same number of charges after it's polymorphed, a sword will still
have the same blessing/curse after being polymorphed, and will still be plus
or minus whatever it was before.  Thus, it's a good plan to remove all the
curses on items (along with any minuses on weapons) before polypiling.  This
can be accomplished by zapping a wand of cancellation at the item(s).  Just
be careful, though, because this will also remove blessings and bonuses that
the weapon might have, which you might want to keep.

The final rule to remember is that certain "polypile abuses" which used to be
quite common no longer work.  You can no longer polymorph a wand into a wand
of wishing, and you can no longer polymorph a tool into a magic lamp.  Thus,
you can't gain (basically) infinite wishes.  Also, it is no longer possible
to gain named weapons (artifacts) via polypiling.

Oh, one of the nice things to remember about poly-piling is that corpses will
always be turned into a regular type of food, that is not spoiled.  So, if
you kill off a large room full of monsters, pile up the corpses and zap them
all with the wand of polymorph.  You'll end up with a pile of food rations,
melons, candy bars, slime molds, and the like, which won't spoil, unlike the
corpses.  This can also be a handy trick to get tins of spinach.

Scenario 3:  Another classical form of nethack abuse is known as the "Troll
Dance of Death."  It is named this because of the fact that trolls have the
uncanny ability to come back from the dead if the corpse is not disposed of.
However, no matter how many times a troll dies, you always get experience
points for killing him, and there's always a chance that he'll be carrying
something when he dies, even if he wasn't the last time you killed him.

Thus, once you have a fairly powerful character, if you want to gain
experience points and possibility quite a few good items, find a troll and
engage him in the dance of death.  Kill him, then pick up anything good you
might find on the corpse.  Wait for a bit (whilst regaining hit points) until
he raises from the dead, and then kill him again.  You can keep this up
basically indefinitely, and the only precautions you might want to take are
to prevent other creatures from entering the room where you're having fun.
This can be easily accomplished by engraving Elbereth in the doorways.  Have
fun!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected In Version 3.1:

Many people have wondered about the fabled version 3.1 of Nethack.  This new
version has been in the works by the nethack "Dev Team" for a period of more
than a year now, and it is still hush-hush, with no release date(s) given or
projected.  We have, however, managed to glean a few pieces of information
about version 3.1 of nethack, and have included them here for you.

STOP DROOLING!

All right then...  On to the details:

Messages will be more verbose when you are using artifacts.  For instance,
Stormbringer currently tells you "The black blade drains life from the
(insert poor hapless creature's name here)."  Fire brand, for instance, might
say "The fiery blade burns the (monster)," or, if the monster was immune,
"The (monster) seems not to be affected by the flame of your blade."

The bug that has been running around for quite some time now which allows
bags of holding to hold basically limitless quantities of stuff (by playing
with the blessed/cursed  status of the bag) will be fixed.  Thus, some of the
scores that were being obtained by dilithium crystaldiving will be much more
difficult to get, because the amount of dilithium you can carry out of the
dungeon will be severely limited.

The entire vision and display system of nethack has been re-written.  Among
other things, this will fix the annoying problem of teleported stuff not
showing up on your screen or creating blank spots randomly scattered around
the screen.  Question:  Will this mean that nethack will now have an improved
line of sight algorithm, similar to the one currently being used in Moria?

New ranged effects have been added.  This will allow, for instance, fireballs
to go until they hit a monster and then explode in a radius around that
monster, instead of just going in a line like they currently do.  It is also
rumored that various other cloud type effects will be included.

There will supposedly be several new special levels and/or rooms, although no
details as to what exactly these will be are available.  Also, nethack's
level handling capabilities have been re-written so that it will now be very
easy for the Dev Team (and others!) to add in new special levels or new
special rooms.

It is rumored that some "Nethack Abuses" have been made impossible.
Specifically, paralyzing the Wizard of Yendor and taking advantage of kicking
sinks have supposedly been fixed or limited.
