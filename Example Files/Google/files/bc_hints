AFTER MANY PEOPLE CRYING OUT FOR HELP FOR THIS WONDERFUL GAME I HAVE DECIDE 
TO TYPE OUT THE HINTS FOR THIS AWESOME ADVENTURE...I WILL BE DOING A LEVEL 
A DAY, INCLUDING A 'PRINTABLE' MAP OF EACH LEVEL THAT HAS EACH OF THE NUMBERS
ON IT!

USAGE: THE FIRST NUMBER IS THE NUMBER OF THE HINT OF THAT LEVEL.
       THEN COMES THE COORDINATES OF THE LOCATION OF WHAT TO DO.
       THEN COMES THE HINT AND WHAT THE RESULTS ARE.
       THEN I HAVE THE COORDINATES OF WHERE THE RESULTS HAPPENED.

NOTE: MAP COORDINATES ARE(X POSITION, Y POSITION, LEVEL#)
      MU = MAGIC USER
      CLERIC = CLERIC CHARACTER
      DRUID = DRUID CHARACTER
      FIGHTER = FIGHTER CHARACTER
