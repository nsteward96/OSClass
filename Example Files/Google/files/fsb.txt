CONTROL

The ability to control one's own inner Force.  A Jedi with this skill 
learns mastery over the functions of his own body and harmony with 
nature.  A character who learns control  automatically learns three 
control  Force powers.


Absorb/Dissipate Energy
	
	Control Difficulty: Sunburn - Very Easy;  intense sun - Easy;  
solar wind - Moderate;  radiation storm - Difficult. Characters may use 
this power for energy attacks, such as blaster bolts and force lightning 
- the difficulty is Moderate plus the damage roll of the attack.

	The power may be kept "up" as long as the source of energy is 
constant - it may not be kept "up" for blaster bolts or  Force 
lightning.

	Effect:  This power allows the Jedi to absorb or dissipate energy, 
including light, heat, radiation and blaster bolts.  A successful 
control  roll means that the energy is dissipated.  If the user fails 
the roll, he takes full damage from the energy.
	The character must activate the power in the same round to absorb 
the blaster bolt or Force lightning - the character must be able to roll 
the power before the attack lands.  He can't use the power after the 
attack has hit.


Accelerate Healing
	
	Control Difficulty:  Easy for wounded characters, Moderate for 
incapacitated characters, Difficult for mortally wounded characters.
	Time to use:  One minute
	Effect:  If a Jedi uses this power successfully, He may make two 
natural healing rolls for the current day regardless of his injury.  He 
gets a +2 modifier to his roll for  both rolls.
Control Pain
	
	Control Difficulty:  Very Easy for wounded characters,  Easy for 
incapacitated characters,  Difficult for mortally wounded characters.  
The difficulty for stunned characters is Easy if the character has not 
fallen unconscious and Moderate if he has.
	Effect:  A wounded Jedi who controls pain  can act as if he has 
not been wounded,  starting with the round after the roll is made.  His 
wound is not healed,  but it is ignored(no die roll reductions).  He 
still needs to receive medical treatment as soon as possible  A Wounded 
character who control pain and is wounded again becomes incapacitated.
	Characters who use control pain to shrug off the effects of stun 
damage eliminate the effects of the stun entirely.
	If a Jedi is in pain for a reason other than a wound, this skill 
can be used to ignore the pain and function normally.  This power can be 
kept "up."


Detoxify Poison
	
	Control Difficulty:   Very easy for a very mild poison (alcohol);  
Easy for a mild poison;  Moderate for an average poison;  Difficult for 
a virulent poison;  Very Difficult to Heroic for a neurotoxin.
	Time to use:  Five minutes
	Effect:  This power allows a Jedi to detoxify or eject poisons 
that have entered his body.  If the Jedi makes the power roll,  the 
poison doesn't affect him.


Emptiness 
	
	Control Difficulty:   Moderate
	Note:   Characters who are consumed by the Dark Side of the Force 
may not use this power.
	Required Powers:  Hibernation trance
	Effect:   The user empties his mind and allows the Force to flow 
through him.  The character seems to be in a deep meditation,  and a 
character experiencing emptiness is oblivious to his surroundings.  A 
character in emptiness  may not move or take any action except to try to 
disengage from the emptiness.
	While in emptiness ,  a character is difficult to sense or affect 
with the Force.  When another character attempts to use a Force power on 
a character in emptiness ,   add the meditating character's emptiness  
roll to the difficulty for the other character's sense  or control  
rolls (this affects only  the  sense  roll;  if the power doesn't use 
the sense skill, then add the difficulty to the control  roll).  This 
difficulty is added regardless of whether or not the empty  character 
would be willingly receive the power's 
effect.
	Once the character comes out of emptiness ,  the character gets a 
+6 bonus modifier to all Force skill rolls for a period of time equal to 
the amount of time the character spent in emptiness .  This bonus is 
reduced by 1 for each Dark Side Point that the character has.
	When in emptiness ,  characters dehydrate and hunger normally - 
some initiates have died  because they lacked enough control to bring  
themselves out of emptiness.
	When a character enters into emptiness ,  the player must state 
for how long the character will be in meditation.  A character must make 
a difficult control  skill roll to bring himself out of emptiness ;  the 
character may attempt to come out of meditation under the following 
circumstances:

   * When the stated  time has passed.

   * Once each hour beyond the original time limit.

   * The character's body  takes any damage more serious  than stun  
damage.


Enhanced Attribute
	
     "And  suddenly  Luke was gone,  a single leap  taking  him to the  
top of  the X-wing..."

	Control Difficulty:  Moderate
	Effect:  A Jedi uses this power to increase a single attribute for 
a limited amount of  time.  An increased attribute can help a Jedi jump 
higher,  dodge quicker,  see better,  and run faster.  All skills 
controlled by the enhanced attribute are increased by the appropriate 
amount for as long as the power is in effect.


	An attribute increased by this power remains enhanced for the 
duration listed below.  Duration and attribute increase is determined by 
how much a character's control  skill roll beats the difficulty number.   
Duration can be extended through the use of character points - for every 
character point a Jedi spends after invoking this power,  the duration 
is extended by one combat round.  The points can be spent at any time 
before the power fades.
	A Jedi can only increase one attribute at a time.  If a character 
invokes the power to enhance a second attribute while the first 
attribute is still enhanced,  then the first enhancement fades and the 
second attribute receives the benefit.

Skill roll Beats	Attribute	
	     Difficulty  By	    Increase	Duration
	               
	              0-13		       +1D	 3 rounds
	             14-25		       +2D	 2 rounds
	               26+		     +3D 	1 round


Hibernation Trance
	
	Control Difficulty:  Difficult
	Effect:  Using this power causes a Jedi to fall into a deep 
trance,  remarkably slowing all body functions.  His heartbeat slows,  
his breathing drops to barely perceivable levels,  and he falls 
unconscious.  
	Hibernation trance  serves two purposes.  It allows a Jedi to 
"play dead."  It can also be used to survive when food  or air supplies 
are low.  Anyone who comes across a Jedi in hibernation trance  assumes 
the Jedi is dead unless he makes a point of testing him.  Another Jedi 
with the Life detection  power and the sense  skill will be able to 
detect the Force within the hibernating character and realize he is 
still alive.
	A hibernating  character uses about one tenth as much air as 
someone who is simply sleeping.  He can hibernate for a week in a dry 
climate or for up to a month in a wet one before dying from lack of 
water.
	A character can decide what stimuli will bring him out of the 
trance,  or how long he will spend in the trance before coming out of 
it.  The stimuli or length of time must be declared when the character 
enters the trance.


Instinctive Astrogation Control

	Control Difficulty: Very Difficult. Modified by astrogation  
difficulty.
	Time To Use:  One minute
	Effect: Instinctive Astrogation Control  is far more difficult 
than the standard sense -based instinctive astrogation  power because 
instead of trying to "feel" the correct solutions to the hyperspace 
equations, the Jedicalculates them in his head.  This is quite possible, 
and is often done as a training exercise, but the figures generated are 
rarely  utilized because it is so easy even for a Jedi to make a 
mistake.
	The  difficulty number is modified by how hard the task is with 
the nav computer:
		Task is:			Modifier (add  to difficulty):

		Very Easy 				       0
		Easy					     +5
		Moderate				     +10
		Difficult				     +15
		Very Difficult			     +20
		Heroic				     +30


	If the control  total is successful,  a Very Easy astrogation  
roll is necessary to enter the correct routes into the nav computer.  If 
the Jedi fails the attempt, he overlooks an obstacle, and sends the ship 
downan inherently dangerous path and thus instaed of requiring a Very 
Easy astrogation  total, the difficulty is automatically Very Difficult. 
If the control  roll is missed by five or more points, increase the 
difficulty to Heroic.
	This is a largely unknown application of the control  power that 
allows Jedi to plot astrogation paths, instead of using the more well-
known sense -based instinctive astrogation  power. Instinctive 
astrogation control  is little more than curiosity, studied only by a 
few theoretical Jedi, the most prominent of which in recent memory was 
Hart Daele.  In fact, Daele wrote a doctoral thesis on the subject, 
proving that the high-order equations could be solved or under certain 
special case situations, appoximated, using standard Jedi mediation 
techniques.


Rage
	
	Control Difficulty:  Difficult
	Required Power:  Hibernation trance
	WARNING:  A Jedi who uses this power gains a Dark Side Point
	Note:  This power can only be used by characters who have been 
consumed by the Dark Side of the Force.
	Effect:  This power allows a character to feel the dread influence 
of the Dark Side.  It functions as a counterpart to emptiness.
	The character must tense herself completely,  and allow the 
mindless rage of the Dark Side to possess her.  When using this power,  
a character will appear lifeless.  They are amplifying the negative 
aspects of their own personality,   Leaving the face clenched in a 
rictus of horror and fear.
	A character must determine how long she wishes to be in rage  when 
she enters the trance.  Barring an attack or the arrival of a specific 
person (as explained below),  the Jedi will stay in the trance for the 
chosen duration.   The Jedi must make a difficult control  roll for 
every four hours in the trance or she will have to come out of the 
trance.
	When the Jedi leaves this state,  she gets a +10 modifier to all 
Force skill rolls for a period of time equal to the time spent in rage.   
The character take son die of damage for every two hours they were in 
the trance after the bonus has subsided.
	Like emptiness,  this power makes characters oblivious to their 
surroundings; they cannot move.  Unlike emptiness,  however, characters 
this state strongly exude the Dark Side.  The internal focusing does 
provide some protection for the character against others using the force 
on them.  Add the rage control  roll to the difficulty roll when another 
attempts to use a force power on someone in rage.
	Characters hunger and dehydrate twice as fast normally when using 
rage  and are even more susceptible to damage (-1D to Strength  to 
resist damage from physical and energy attacks while in this state).  
Characters who plan on an extended trance will need intravenous 
nourishment.
	In rage,  the character is less oblivious to her surroundings than 
a corresponding Jedi in emptiness.   For example, any physical contact 
by a living being may revive them (the Jedi must make a Difficult 
control  roll to cease the attack before the offending character has 
been killed.
	A character using rage  can choose to anticipate the arrival of a 
foe. They must make a Difficult sense  roll (modified by relationship) 
with the life sense  power at the time they enter rage.  This will allow 
them to instantly awaken (Easy control  roll) if the expected person 
comes within five meters of the person in rage.  


	Example:  While preparing  to transfer his life to a new clone 
body, Palpatine expects an attack from Luke Skywalker.  When he enters 
rage, he must also make a Difficult sense roll using the life sense 
power to anticipate Luke entering the Clone Chamber. The difficulty is 
20, +7 for relationship (they are acquaintances)  to equal 27, plus 
Palpatine suffers a penalty for having to make two skill uses in one 
round:  the sense roll for life sense and the control roll for rage.  
Palpatine's roll is 44, so when Luke enters the chamber, Palpatine 
instantly wakes from his rage and confronts  Luke...

	This power may be used in a preparation ritual for the transfer 
life   power. When a raged   person uses transfer life,  the original 
body is instantly and totally consumed by the Dark Side, often bursting 
into unholy blue flames.  For every three points by which the control  
roll exceeded the rage  difficulty,  the body does 1D damage upon 
explosion (three meter blast radius).

	Example:  Palpatine,  while confronting Luke in the Clone Chamber,  
has been in rage for three hours, gaining +10 to all is Force skills.  
Palpatine's difficulty roll was 20. He rolled a 35.  He successfully 
uses the   transfer life power and his old body explodes in a 5D damage 
burst of flame.



Reduce Injury
	
	Control Difficulty:  Moderate for incapacitated characters,  
Difficult for mortally wounded characters,  Very Difficult for Dead 
Characters.
	Required  Powers:  Control pain
	Note:  Spending Force points in this manner - not at the beginning 
of the round - is  allowed.  Also, it is not always a "selfish" act to 
save one's life,  so the character might  be able to get the Force point 
back.  If  the character was fighting to save his friends from certain 
doom - and if he falls,  they certainly  die - then this could even be 
considered an heroic action.  It still involves great sacrifice.
	Effect:  By using this power, a Jedi may call upon the Force to 
reduce the amount of injury he suffers;  this power is normally only 
used in desperation because of its long-term repercussions.
	When the power is successfully used,  The Jedi loses a Force 
point.  Any injury that is suffered is reduced to a wounded.  If the 
original injury would have killed the character,  he must choose to 
suffer a permanent injury of some kind.

	Example:  Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are fighting in the 
Emperor's chambers on the new Death Star.  Luke batters down Vader's 
defenses and makes a killing strike - But Vader uses the  reduce injury 
power and expends a Force point.  He is now only  wounded, but he loses 
his hand.

Remain Conscious

	Control Difficulty:  Easy for stunned characters,  Moderate for 
incapacitated characters,  Difficult for mortally wounded characters.
	Required Powers:  Control Pain
	Effect:  Remain conscious  allows a Jedi to remain conscious even 
when he has suffered injuries which would knock him unconscious.  In 
game terms,  when a character with this power suffers this kind of 
injury,  they lose all of their actions for the rest of the round,  but 
they are still conscious (normal characters automatically pass out).  On 
the next round,   the character may attempt to activate the power - this 
must be the first action of that round;  the Jedi cannot even dodge  or 
parry.

	If the roll is unsuccessful,  the character passes out 
immediately.  If the roll is successful, the Jedi can do any one other 
action that he has declared for that round - often the character will 
attempt control pain so that he will be able to remain conscious.  After 
that other action has been completed,  the Jedi will lapse into 
Unconsciousness,  unless he has activated control pain  or done 
something else that will keep the character conscious.
 

Resist Stun
	
	Control Difficulty:  Moderate
	Time To Use:  One Minute
	This power may be kept "up."
	Effect:  Resist stun  allows the Jedi to prepare his body to 
resist the effects of stun damage.  The power must be activated before 
the character has suffered any damage.
	Asuccessful result allows the Jedi to resist all stun results 
except for unconscious  and normal injuries.  An unconscious  result 
forces the Jedi to drop the power,  and he is considered stunned.   
Normal injuries (wounded,  incapacitated,  mortally wounded   and killed  
) are treated normally.


Short-Term Memory Enhancement

	"Luke closed his eyes,  reaching inward with the Force.  Short-
term memory enhancement was one of the Jedi skills he'd learned from 
Yoda.  The pictures flowed swiftly backward in time:  his walk to the 
medical wing, his conversation with Wedge, his hunt for a public comm 
desk ..."
	
	Control Difficulty:  Difficult
	Required Powers:  Hibernation trance
	Effect:  When a Jedi uses this power,  he or she can replay recent 
events in order to more carefully examine images and peripheral 
occurances.  Using the power, a Jedi can freeze images and even scan 
memory  tracks to recall details that were seen but did 
not register consciously at the time of observation.
	In game terms,  this power can be used to alert  a Jedi to 
information,  items,  other characters,  or anything else that passed 
before his or her senses within a specific span of time.  In addition,  
if a gamemaster provided clues or leads to clues the players originally 
missed or ignored,  this power can be used to recall them.  When players 
get stuck on a puzzle or a mystery within an adventure,  this power can 
alert them to possible solutions,  if those solutions were observed 
earlier in the adventure.
	How far back a Jedi can remember with this power is determined by 
the success of his control  skill roll.
