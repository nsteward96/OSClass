1.  Story.

Released by Capcom in the summer of 1994, Alien vs. Predator is
loosely based on the movies _Alien_ and _Predator_ and is the latest
of the Final-Fight genre games. The setting is San Drad, California,
the largest city on the West Coast. The Wayland Yutani Corporation is
developing biological weapons. An emergency situation occurs, and in
72 hours, San Drad is overrun by Aliens. Incredibly outnumbered, two
heroes, Dutch Schaefer and Linn Kurosawa, fight the Aliens in a
losing battle. And when all seems lost, Predators materialize and side
with the heroes to join in the "Hunt".

The "Hunt" begins. Round 1 is "City of Despair". The fight takes place
in the city amid hordes of Aliens. The boss is the Alien guard
Chrysalis. Round 2 is "War in the Underpass". The fight continues in
the sewers beneath the city. The boss is the fast and deadly Razor
Claws. Round 3 is "Forced Assault". Atop a moving APC, the hunters
shoot at Aliens as they storm their way to the Queen's liar. The boss
is the agile Arachnoid. Round 4 is "Assault on a Queen". The fight
takes the hunters directly to the Queen. The boss is the first Alien
Queen. Round 5 is "Secrets". Investigating the crash of an aerial
transport, the hunters find that the Aliens are part of a biological
weapons development. The boss is a military service Power Loader.
Round 6 is "Nightmare in the Lab". The fight is now inside the
laboratories. The boss is the powerful "Mad Predator". Round 7 is
"Hunt's End". The fight takes place aboard a space craft in outer
space. The boss is the second Alien Queen.

Having defeated the Alien Queen, the hunters board a escape pod and
direct the space craft to crash on the base and explode on impact. The
resulting explosion destroys all remaining Aliens. Then back on the
planet, the Predators give the heroes the Alien Queen's tail hook. The
Predators leave as the heroes wonder why they helped them.

Note: Round 6, "Nightmare in the Lab", has a special stage where
characters must destroy a control box. Failure to destroy it in 20
seconds results in a crash, inflicting damage to the characters.

3.  Weapons.

The Predators are armed with shoulder cannons. The cannon fires single
shots. On the ground, the cannon automatically targets the first enemy
in the line of sight but cannot seem to track Chest Busters, Face
Huggers, and the first Alien Queen. In the air, the cannon initially
fires in the direction of the joystick, but the cannon's auto-tracking
takes over almost immediately. Direct hits result in explosions
affecting the target and other enemies near it. Those affected are
enveloped in flame and are knocked down (except Alien Queens and Power
Loaders). The reload status bar indicates firing availability. Each
time the cannon is fired, the reload status bar decreases. If the
reload status bar is totally depleted, the cannon has overheated,
otherwise the reload status bar continuously refills. The cannon can
QUICKLY overheat. The Warrior's native weapon is the spear, and the
Hunter's native weapon is the halberd. They cannot use other melee
weapons. They simply throw them.

Schaefer is armed with a smart gun rig on his arm. He fires a barrage
of smart gun bullets. On the ground, he fires by waving his arm up and
down covering all angles in the direction he is facing. In the air, he
fires according to the joystick direction. The reload status bar
indicates firing availability. Each time he fires, the reload status
bar decreases. If the reload status bar is totally depleted, the gun
has overheated, otherwise the reload status bar continuously refills.
Schaefer carries no melee weapons, but he can use ANY weapon that he
picks up, including the Warrior's spear, the Hunter's halberd, and
Linn's katana. 

Linn is armed with a large caliber automatic pistol. She fires a
stream of pulse gun bullets. On the ground, she fires an initial burst
striking the ground and then proceeds to shoot horizontally in the
direction she is facing. In the air, she fires according to the
joystick direction. The reload status bar indicates firing
availability. Each time she fires, the reload status bar decreases.
Unlike the Predators or Schaefer, Linn does not have continuous
refill. When the reload status bar is depleted, she must stop and
reload her gun. Reload occurs immediately after depletion, even when
surrounded by enemies. During reload, she is COMPLETELY VULNERABLE.
Linn's native weapon is the katana. She cannot use other melee
weapons. She simply throws them.

Other Weapons:
Super Cartridge: A character picking up this item can continuously
           use his weapon to fire unlimited amount of rounds in a ten
           second period. Super cartridges are found in some
           containers and also appear whenever a player joins a game
           in progress.

Knife:     Basic weapon that affects all enemies in the line of
           projection. This weapon is simply picked up and thrown. If
           it hits a wall, it falls to the ground.

Disc:      When thrown, the disc returns to the thrower along the line
           of projection. If the thrower is not on the same horizontal
           plane as the disc during its return, the disc will travel
           off the screen and is lost. The disc is capable of knocking
           down enemies with a single hit. Linn can use the disc to
           hit enemies on the ground. If it hits a wall, it falls to
           the ground.

Flame Thrower: Use with care. Each blast lasts about a second, leaving
           your backside vulnerable. This weapon is short-lived but is
           very effective against hordes.

Pipe:      A simple but effective weapon. Schaefer is the only one who
           can use it to repeatedly smash enemies. The Predators and
           Linn simply throw it. If it hits a wall, it falls to the
           ground.

Pulse Gun: A very effective weapon that bombards enemies with
           constant fire. It has long range and is useful against
           bosses. The bullets do not go through enemies.

Smart Gun: Improvement over the Pulse Gun. More firepower. Unlike the
           pulse gun, the smart gun shoots bullets that go through
           enemies, affecting all in the line of fire.

Hand Grenade: Powerful hand-thrown weapons. The explosion affects the
           target and other enemies near it. Those affected are
           enveloped in flame and are knocked down (except Alien
           Queens). This weapon is very effective against Power
           Loaders. If an enemy soldier is hit before he throws a
           grenade, the fallen grenade can be picked up and used.
           Grenades hit in mid-air can also be picked up and used.

Grenade Launcher: Improvement over hand grenades. This is a very
           powerful weapon. If the grenade hits, the following
           explosion propagates to enemies that are in the direction
           of firing. If fired from one end of the screen, one direct
           hit is capable of enveloping in flames all enemies on
           screen.





4.  Items.

There are numerous items placed throughout the game to aid you in your
fight. Some items restore partial health, and some simply increase
your score. The items are stored in some form of container, but be
cautious, some containers store Aliens.

|_________________________________|__________________________________|

|-Predator Warrior---------------------------------------------------|
|   The Warrior's normal attack pattern is three spear swipes        |
|   followed by a stationary pole vault-like kick. This final kick   |
|   has just a tad less range than the spean swipes, and sometimes   |
|   misses the target. If weaponless, he punches instead. If he is   |
|   hit by an enemy immediately behind him while attacking, he will  |
|   execute a reverse sweep.                                         |

|   After initiating a Dash Kick, it is possible to land multiple    |
|   kicks by further pressing the ATTACK button each time the        |
|   Warrior connects with a target. Furthermore, the Warrior will    |
|   rebound from connection in the current direction of the          |
|   joystick, making it possible to dash into a group of aliens,     |
|   kick several, and then bounce out without ever touching the      |

|   After initiating a Dash Knee, it is possible to turn it into a   |
|   Dash Lunge Punch by pressing the ATTACK button once upon         |
|   connecting with a target.                                        |
