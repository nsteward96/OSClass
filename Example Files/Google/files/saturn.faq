I admit the last version was a little inaccurate with regards to the
Jupiter, however the more that contact me with extra information the
more definitative this FAQ will become. The FAQ has also become expanded
to cover some 32x/Mars information - though the main topic of the FAQ
will still be the Saturn. If somebody else is willing to start a
separate 32X/Mars FAQ I'll be glad to transfer the relevent information
to them. Changes are marked with a <**> next to them.

Q: What the heck is the Saturn?

A: The Saturn is the latest video game console that is currently in
   production by Sega Enterprises. Development on the Saturn has been
   continuing for approximately the last 6-12 months, for a release some
   time later this year (1994).
      Sega has provided the Saturn as the next step up in its range of
   highly popular games consoles that began with the 8 bit Master
   System, and most recently the 16 bit Genesis and Sega-CD. Each of
   these systems has sold many millions of games and units across the
   world, making Sega currently the second biggest, if not the biggest
   video game manufacturer world-wide.
      Saturn is aimed to provide a direct competition with new consoles
   such as the 3DO, Atari Jaguar, and Commodore (now in liquidation)
   CD32. It also aims to compete against other upcoming consoles such as
   the Sony Playstation-X (or PS-X, also due late 1994), and eventually
   against Sega's main rival, Nintendo. Nintendo, who in cooperation
   with Silicon Graphics are to produce a 64 bit games console
   containing much of the technology now implemented in SGI's Onyx
   workstations for release in <**> mid 1995.
      In technical terms, the Saturn will be a fully 32 bit console that
   will offer specialised multi-media capabilities many times greater
   than most computer systems at a much cheaper price. Sprite and
   rendered graphics will be a natural function of the hardware, and
   handled with ease. <**> Sega is also looking into the Saturn being
   compatible with MPEG1 as standard if costs permit, allowing the
   playing of movies on CD. Software that will be available ranges from
   sports to highly frantic arcade games, or anything else you can dream
   up. <**> Saturn is also aims to be one of the few consoles to
   specifically plan and take into account the integration into online
   interactive networks.


Q: So what is the Jupiter I have head of?

A: <**> (just about everything changed). In April it was announced by
   many magazines that Sega would be releasing a Jupiter console, a
   cartridge only, and slightly lesser version of the Saturn. Recently
   plans for the Jupiter were shelved (if in fact we were going to see a
   Jupiter at all), probably due to production costs which would have
   pushed the machine past what Sega was aiming to sell it for. In order
   to be able to release a cheaper system, their current plans are for
   the 32X/Mars system.


Q: Okay then, so what is the 32X?

A: It is now official that the 32X is going to be the 'lesser' of Sega's
   two new machines, for release at about the same time as the Saturn.
   What the 32X will be is an add on for existing Genesis/Megadrive
   owners, which when plugged into the general expansion port will
   provide extra processing power and other enhancements to your old
   machine.
      32X will be cartridge only, and not expected to be upgradeable to
   the Saturn (which was first planned with the Jupiter). The 32X will
   also include only two specially designed processors, whereas the
   Saturn will contain a predicted seven.
      For those who own a SegaCD the 32X will take advantage of this to
   provide 32X CD games. Basically if you have a SegaCD it will use the
   extra capabilities of the machine, in addition to that of the Genesis
   itself and 32X. Several of these 32X/CD games are already in
   production. The reason for this seems to be so that Sega can boost
   sales of the largely flailing SegaCD, while also cutting prices on
   the 32X by not having to include a CD-drive. It is expected that
   prices for the SegaCD will drop to increase sales for the 32X/CD
   combination.

      How did this come about? Most believe that Sega initially was at
   work on a cartridge only machine, however due to the market pressure
   of CD becoming standard, Sega was persuaded to integrate CD storage
   into their machine. Rather than waste this technology, they opted to
   use some of the technology in a cheaper, less powerful console.


<**> Q: So what is the Mars also talked about?

A: The Mars is simply a PAL version of the 32X for release in places
   such as Australia, some parts of Asia, and Europe. Take the Genesis
   and Megadrive as a similar situation, pretty much the same system,
   but with a different name. It is expected that neither systems will
   be compatible with each other, to prevent uncontrolled 'grey'
   importing.

                                                  
Q: Who is supporting the Saturn/32X?

A: The Saturn is essentially a product of Sega's own inguinuity, and
   most of the machine as in fact designed and built by Sega singularly.
   Apparently a British firm was involved in one or more of the chip
   design, however most dedicated components such as main processor,
   co-processor, etc were designed by Japanese firms (such as Hitachi).
   These companies have nothing more to do with the Saturn than actual
   chip design and production.
      The other big news is that Microsoft have made a commitment to
   Saturn by developing the software for the machine. It is expected
   that this revolves around Microsoft's GUI Windows operating system,
   though how active this becomes part of the system to the end-user is
   unsure. Microsoft is also interesting in extending its market
   interests by helping to develop the Sega Channel and its ultimate aim
   of becoming the main player in a future global interactive network.
      Major software developers keen on producing Saturn titles include
   Sony, Bandia, Konami, <**> ID software (not as big, but everbody 
   will still be interested!), Namco, plus too many more to 
   mention here.


Q: How does the Sega channel fit into this?

A: Sega Channel is a venture undertaken by Sega to provide an expansive
   and large online network for game players of Saturn, and possibly
   other machines (though unlikely). <**> It seems unlikely that the 32X
   will be SegaChannel compatible due to the speed of the internal bus.
      The system is currently  undergoing trials in the United States
   and Japan to investigate its viability. When in place the Sega
   Channel which operate much like your standard cable television
   provider, except rather than offering programs it offers games and
   other services. Some of these services include the possibility of
   online shopping, a gamers database, game related message facilities,
   and probably more to be announced.

      The main aim of the Sega Channel however is to provide games on
   demand. For an monthly access fee of $20-$30 (plus the possibility of
   online charges), subscribers are continously sent game data for a
   game of their choice to their Saturn or possibly 32X. Playing a Sega
   Channel game would be similar to the game being in the player's own
   machine, except the game is erased from memory after the game is
   completed. Such a network also allows the exciting possibility of
   country-wide (or even worldwide) games with many different players.


Q: What titles are in production?

A: Here is a list of the more popular known titles that are in
   production at the present time <**> FOR THE SATURN. Approximately 40
   other titles will be going into production in the next few months, so
   this is just a small sample.

* Virtua Racing Deluxe (Sega) - An _exact_ (everything) conversion of the
  extremely popular arcade driving game. Saturn can easily replicate
  what the arcade machine (called Model 1 by Sega) does, so that may
  give you a further indication of the Saturn's capabilities. Virtua
  Racing includes multiple viewpoints, multiple courses and will allow
  the linking of machines for multi-player races. <**> A 32X 
  version is also planned. 

* Virtua Soccer (Sega) - A polygon/texture-mapped sports game including
  multi camera views, different teams plus multi-player support. <**>
  This maybe become an officially licensed Soccer game for the World
  Cup.

* <**> Virtua Fighter (Sega) - Another _exact_ conversion of the popular
  arcade fighting game using polygon created fighters. SF2 like game
  with multiple characters and moves plus a number of different endings.

* Daytona Racing (Sega) - Another driving/racing game which is based on
  production cars. Includes Goudrad shaded graphics, truly three
  dimensional tracks, multiple courses plus many different car options.
  This uses a newer board (Model 2) to Virtua Racing & Fighting, and
  what what you will see from this game is coming up to par on what the
  Saturn can do near its best.

Screen shots of all these titles have been witnessed.


Q: How much will it cost?

A: While costs of these machines have yet to be exactly formalised,
   estimates put the Saturn at $450US and the 32X at $150US. This is
   expected to include at least one software title, possibly Virtua
   Racing or a new Sonic title ;)
      Software is expected to be in the region of $70-$100. How this
   will vary between the Saturn and 32X is unknown.


Q: When/Where will it be available?

A: The Saturn will first be released in Japan in November this year.
   <**> United States release is expected to in early 1995, and
   definitely "before the release of Project Reality" according to Sega.
   European/Australian/Canada/elsewhere release is likely to be in about
   June-July next year.

   <**> United States release of the 32X is expected to be in
   mid-November, or at least before Christmas. It is not expected that
   the 32X will even be released in Japan, due to the Genesis' relative
   lack of popularity. Europe/Australia/Canada/elsewhere release of 32X
   is likely to be in December-January at the end of the year.

   No dates have really been finalised or confirmed for either machines.


Q: Will the Saturn be compatible with the Genesis or SegaCD?

A: No. The Saturn will not be able to play Genesis or SegaCD software,
   and there are no plans for an optional plug-in convertor. Very
   initially the plan was to remain backward compatible with these
   machines, however this plan was soon shelved.


<**> Q: Will the Saturn be compatible with the 32X?

A: It is pretty unlikely that this will be the case. While the 32X
   implements some Saturn technology, the wide technological difference
   between the two means this is not really possible (or probably
   desirable). 32X relies on Genesis capabilities that the Saturn simply
   doesn't include, so the answer is basically no.


Q: What are the specifications of the Saturn?

A: Here is what Sega will let on currently:

   PROCESSOR: Twin Hitachi SH2 32 bit RISC Chip
                      - Clock speed of 27Mhz

            Cartridge (no longer certain)
              - System upgradable


<**> Q: What are the specifications of the 32X?

A: This is even less known that that of the Saturn at the present time.
   What is believed at present is the following:

   PROCESSOR: Twin Hitachi 32 bit RISC processors
                      - clock speed of 23 MHZ
                      - 40 MIPS

   CO-PROCESSOR(s): Existing Genesis 68000, SegaCD and other chips

          - (Genesis resolution?)
          - Overlaying over existing Genesis/SegaCD video

   MEMORY: 512k (4 mbit) additional RAM to Genesis/SegaCD memory

   AUDIO: Stereo PCM chip
              - audio mixing with Genesis sound
              - additional 2 channels (therefore 14 all together?)

   I/O: ???

   STORAGE: CD-ROM if you have a SegaCD
               - speed same as SegaCD
               - compatible with audio CD, CD&G, SegaCD

            Cartridge
               - compatible with Genesis


Q: So which 32 bit system is the more powerful?

A: At the present, without a working model to benchmark it is a little
   hard to tell which system really is the most powerful. Even when a
   working model is demonstrated, due to highly different architecture,
   comparing simply specifications will not really give you an
   indication of which system is the most powerful. Depending on the
   type of software and complexity, this will vary between systems.
      For computer addicts, a rough indication is that Saturn in raw
   processing power is likely to be as powerful as a 486dx33 - though of
   course with specialised capability to manipulate graphics, many times
   more efficiency.


Q: So which 32 bit+ system should I choose?

A: That is a question which ultimately has to be left up to the
   individual player. However, the Saturn/32X offers a system which
   is supported by one the biggest video game companies, that being
   Sega -- meaning a wealth of software and retail support.
      For more mature players (that is open to interprutation) the
   Saturn may not provide enough mature titles to make a purchase
   worthwhile. While it will provide a lot more variety than some might
   otherwise be used to with the Genesis and Sega-CD machines, Sega
   has really aimed these machines at the younger/family market.
      Bang for buck, the Saturn offers a lot more power than equivelent
   machines at pretty much equal price. What may ultimately be the
   difference to many is price of software -- while some companies are
   now selling latest releases at $50-$70, it is expected that Saturn
   releases could be in the region of $70-$100.
