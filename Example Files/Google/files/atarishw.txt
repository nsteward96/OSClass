 Pre-Labor Day Atari Event Slated Returns to Bridgeport

 BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (May 25) - The largest East Coast gathering of Atari
 computer and video game system users will return to Bridgeport,
 Connecticut, on Saturday, August 27 and Sunday, August 28. Connecticut
 AtariFest '94 promises a state-of-art exhibition of products and
 services for Atari desktop and palmtop computers, video and portable
 game systems, software, peripherals and accessories for the fourth
 consecutive year.
   The event, to be staged at the Bridgeport Holiday Inn in downtown
 Bridgeport, is scheduled for 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday (Aug. 27) and
 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday (Aug. 28). The sponsor is ACT Atari Group, a
 network of computer clubs from Bridgeport, Danbury, Hartford, New Haven
 and Wethersfield areas, Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
 Since its debut in Bridgeport in 1991, the show has attracted thousands
 of Atari system owners and onlookers from around the U.S. and Canada. In
 1992 and 1993 the show was held in the Greater Hartford area.
   This year, organizers expect consumer attention to focus on the Jaguar,
 Atari's 64-bit game system that many industry observers believe
 surpasses the technology of Nintendo and Sega, among the most
 widely-sold systems in the U.S. CAF '94 features New England's biggest
 electronic games competition, as well as bargains on hardware and
 software and professional seminars and demonstrations of computer
 graphics, desktop publishing, telecommunications, electronic music, home
 and business applications, and more.
   Admission is $6 for adults, half price for children under 12. Two-day
 passes are $10. An all-you-can-eat, buffet dinner on Saturday is
 available for an additional charge. The Holiday Inn is located within
 two blocks of Interstate 95 (Exit 27), Route 8 (Exit 2), and Amtrak rail
 passenger and Long Island ferry terminals.
