   Welcome to the warp zone!  Hi gang, it's Anthony "Ace" Shubert back to give
 you the dirt the other mags wouldn't tought.  Not with a 25-meter pole. =]
   Are you ready for Mortal Kombat II?  It's confirmed at 32-meg for the Super
 NES and rumored to hit the big 4-0 for the Genesis.  Ouch.  It plays great, as
 I have said before.  How about the missing "Tanya" from the arcade game?
 We'll have to wait-and-see on that one..
   I entered Blockbuster's World Game Championships, coming in second for the
 week in both places that I entered, and have a real shot of winning both
 stores.  [I missed week 2 for the Summer CES, and I'll make it up this
 Saturday.]  I only need to score 80 thousand in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
 Tournament Fighters to win.. shouldn't be TOO hard.  Remember, the winners of
 many stores go to a ADI tournament [ADI is a term used in TV-land, "Area of
 Domestic Influence", to determine what states are important to what areas.]
 and the winners there go on to Ft. Lauderdale for the World Finals.  [Cool!]
   Chris Gore is the head editor of VideoGames magazine.  Now, VG is a great
 mag, but this guy isn't.  He's pretty _low_, actually.  [I thought I put this
 in A's A in GMJ 50, but I was mistaken.]  At Sega's ultra-cool Press Party the
 night before the Summer CES, Zack Maeston and I were talking - Zack is a
 contributing writer often found in Wired magazine - and we see Chris.  I go
 over and talk to him for about 2 minutes.
   "So Chris, how's that online version coming?" I ask him.
   "Well, we're looking into.. do...ing...." and he WALKS AWAY FROM ME,
 mid-sentance.  He trolls around a bit, and then goes into the mens room.
   Jilted?  Yep - I didn't really like that.  As Tanya [Future Wave Editor]
 would say.. "No, not even a little bit."
   So - I told Zack and Chris B. [editor] what I thought about him - and I've
 been advised not to put them in the cyberpages of GMJ.  [Little kids read
 this, after all =]  So.. lets just say that Gore is a Richardhead, and leave
 it at that.
   Whew - flaming a non-Netter.  Oh well..
   More rumors: Midway's Mortal Kombat-esque WWF game for the arcades has been
 delayed until further notice [licensing problems]... Revolution X, a
 shoot-em-up by Midway is BOMBING in the arcades around Boston and Los
 Angeles... Super Bomberman II is going to get a huge push by Hudson Soft as
 that is their onnly major title this fall... 'Sonic and Knuckles' will be a
 Game Genie-like device that attaches to your Sonic 2 or 3, and if you play it
 with Sonic 3 you get the three 'japan only' levels not released in the
 States... and finally some sense: there will not be a Pac-Man 2000 for the
 Jaguar.  Could you picture that one?
   One more rumor that hit my desk this (Tuesday) morning... in the upcoming
 Mortal Kombat III arcade game there will be homage paid to the shareware game
 "Pong Kombat!"  In PK, there are 'spamalities,' a real-life move based on many
 rumors of a spamality in MK2.  Well, rumor has it that Ed Boon and the crew at
 WMS Industries were so impressed that they'll put something very similar im
 MK3.  I'm still waiting for "Tanya wins.. Friendship!" myself...
   Well, gotta fly.  Stay tuned, eat your vitimins, read GMJ and I'll cya next
 Tuesday [or later, if you live overseas.]

    Hi!  I just read your 50th issue of GMJ (Game Master Journal) and I
must say I thought it was excellent.  Now I wan't a subscription.  That CES
coverage was great I must say.  My only objection is that there are so many
great gaming systems that I wan't to buy them all, but alas I can't.  Oh
well!  That's not your fault.  Anyway, congratulations on your magazine and
good luck.

Hello,
Issue 50 is the first issue of your mag that I have seen.  GREAT.  I am an
avid video gamer w/both SEGA, SNES, and a 486/66mhz Gateway.  Could you send me
issues 45-49? OR can I get them via FTP? Can I get a copy of your faq? also
please add me to your mailing list.
In issue 50 you mentioned [See CES report: part 2...] Where can I get that? In
other words you have a great mag and I want more!!!!! :)

        Thanx in advance,
                  Eric

[BDW: Please see the FAQ in this issue.  It has our FTP site [and hopefully, it
      is actually WORKING].
      Many people have asked about [See CES report...] that is our little guide
      to when you can see more.  CES Report part two is this issue, three next
      week, and if needed - a fourth in GMJ 53.                               ]

     Ummm... NBA Jam, meet Barkley Shut Up and Jam, and Barkley Shut Up and
Jam?  Meet your maker... literally.
     Graphically, during the game, this game has nice backgrounds, nice areas
of plays, and BAD looking players.  Sure, you can tell Charles Barkley apart
from the other characters, some of the time anyway.  The characters are pretty
blurry (and this is not because I'm not wearing my glasses), and I must say
that Accolade could have done a better job.  When moving back and forth on the
court, it's hard to tell who you are sometimes for there is no identification
marker, which is a very simple addition to the game.  The nice graphics are
those of a digitized Sir Charles, and that's about it.
     The sound in this game, on the other hand, is very well done.  Some of the
music is just very good.  When you pause the game, Mr. Charles says "Time Out"
and little niceties like that.  After scoring a basket, you hear lots of
yelling from the characters on the floor.  However, this gets a bit repetitive,
but who cares, it sounds good!  The music in the background of the game is nice
as well, with each area of play having different music.
     The game, I must admit, has some nice options.  For example, not only do
you have a single game option, but you can start a series, a tournament,
amongst other things.  You even have the option of continuing a series where
you left off (sounds a bit familiar there, does it not?)  When playing the
game on the court, as mentioned above, a little signal telling you who your
character is would be nice, otherwise playing is pretty easy (sorry folks no
turbo in this one).
     In all, this game really does not seem like anything worth playing.  But,
because I like Sir Charles, I gave it a higher rating.

Cue - 80       Well, if NBA Jams never existed, this game might have made it,
               and people still might buy it for Sir Charles himself, but with
               NBA Jams out there, this game can forget about making anything
               substantial.

Ace - 74       BOR-RING.  Yeah, "Sir Charles" looked okay, but do you really
               want to spend youur money on another basketball game that does
               little to change NBA Jam?  Go buy a 5-player adapter for Jam
               and order pizza instead of buyin' this one.

     With Capcom's release of Super Street Fighter II, most people will
probably overlook Saturday Night SlamMasters.  This game is an excellent arcade
translation, and if ANYTHING should be at least rented just to check it out.
Here is all that dirty stuff about the game.
     Saturday Night Slam Masters, as you may have guessed, is an arcade
translation of the original wrestling game.  Having played both, I must say
that the Super Nintendo version of this game, really does compare to it (much
like the Final Fight/SFII series).  The graphics are very well drawn, but are almost
too much like Street Fighter II.  The graphics in general during the action
are very nicely done.  It looks like Final Fight and/or SFII in a
wrestling ring!  And the characters are most detailed.  You have the ability to
pick between Biff, Gunloc, Oni, Titan, Stingr, Grater, Rasta, and Haggar (yes,
that's Haggar from Final Fight.  Remember?  He was a wrestler.)  The graphics
in play are very detailed, right down to the character introductions in the
beginning of the match.
     The sound in this game consists mainly of music and grunts.  The music is
very appropriate for the area you are playing in, weather it be Los Angeles or
Mexico, or where ever else they decide to stick you.  Each character has his own
theme music, which is a nice addition to the game.  It even has the nicety of
say YOU LOSE after you lose a match.  All the music, as usual, can be played
back through the options screen.  And to me, the title music sounds just a BIT
to much like the Mega Man X theme music.  Oh well.. must be my imagination.
     Control and Playabillity are a big part of a game, and this one delivers
on both.  The
control consists of only 3 buttons, being the attack, jump, and pin buttons.
Moving around, attacking and the such are simple.  However, if you get pinned
by the computer, my recommendation is pull out the Turbo Controller, and let it
do it's job.
     So, if your looking for a good wrestling game, your very close.  Very very
close.  However, this game seems to much like a combination of Street Fighter
II and Final Fight, so I couldn't say it's perfect as a game.  As far as an
arcade translation, I must say it's perfectly done.

Cue - 89       I'm not one to knock Capcom after their Final Fight/Street
               Fighter II/Megaman stuff, but this game could use work to be
               more of a wrestling type game.  Otherwise, I'm impressed.  This
               is a rent-before-you-buy type game.

Ace - 75       Street Fighter In a Ring.  That's it.  This is a direct port of
               the arcade game, but that isn't saying a great deal.  The game
               has more cheezes than a Swiss Winery!  Just be Oni and do that
               Ken/Ryu-like Hurricane Kick and you'll never be touched.
               Really, it looks and sounds and plays great for a FIGHTING game,
               but there is a difference between fighting and wrestling.
               Someone tell Capcom.

Still can't get enough Alien Vs.  Predator after the SNES and Jaguar versions?
In this version, Aliens have infested Earth, and, like the hero or heroine you
are, you've got to save it.  Luckily, you've got some help from two Predators
who have just arrived for a hunt.  The four of you should be able to handle it,
right?

This game is setup like Final Fight, and you have a choice betweeen four
different characters: Maj.  D.  Schaeffer has the best strength , Lt.  Ripley
has the best skill rating, the Predator Hunter has well rounded stats, and the
Predator Warrior has good speed (I think).

Each character has several different attacks, plus a missile weapon whose power
is indicated at the bottom of the screen.  You can also do a spin attack by
pressing the attack and jump buttons (like Final Fight); for example, the
Hunter tosses discs of death around him.  This, like Final Fight, uses energy.


Your jump button really doesn't make you necessarily jump; for example, while
using the Predator Hunter you can push down and jump for a sliding kick, or
horizontally and jump for a dash, etc.  This makes the play control a bit
difficult until you're used to it.

You'll notice that some moves seem to come straight out of SFII, such the
Predator Hunter's (I really like him...:) jump attack, which looks like a
dragon punch.  Unfortunately, there can't be two/three Major Schaeffers, two
Predator Hunters, etc.  because there is no "same character" option.

All in all, the game isn't bad, but it isn't really worth the 50 cents (maybe a
quarter).  It's just another side-scrolling fighting game, and unfortunately,
the catagory has been fairly much expended.  Otherwise, it's a pretty good
game.

An evil force of some kind is uniting the monsters and causing them to attack
humans.  And for an adventurer like you, that's an opportunity to make some
silver pieces.  "Welcome to the D&D world."

Choose from one of four warriors--the dwarf with his excellent endurance, the
fighter for his skill in the way of the sword, the cleric with his power to
heal and destroy the undead, or the elven mage/warrior, with her powers of
magic--and set forth to save the land.

This game is also set up similarily to Final Fight--a side scrolling beat-em-up
escapade, but has many things which set it apart.  For example, you'll probably
first notice that there are four buttons: Attack, Jump, Select Item/Magic, and
Use Item/Magic.  Next, while playing, you'll notice that yes, you can name your
character, and, like Golden Axe II, you can play up to four characters
simultaneously.  Unfortunatly, there can only be one fighter, one mage, one
dwarf, etc.  (ie.  no same profession) Next, you can make decisions as to where
your party goes (Do you want to try and save the fort yourself, or go to the
village and ask someone else to do it?).

There is one thing that sets this game apart from the other typical Final Fight
type: Secret passages.  Another nice touch is that the spellcasters use voice
when casting a spell ("Continual Light!" BLAM!).

Control and graphics are excellent, as is sound.  However, this game suffers in
the originality department, because of it's "Final Fight-ish" approach.
Otherwise the game is pretty good.  Now if only the arcades would stop with the
50 cent bit, I could play this more.

Ace - 95       This is a fantastic game!  Get three of your role-playing
               friends together and do the video roleplaying thing!  It really
               works: you have the characters arguing over which path to take,
               who should get what item, etc.  Great!

The New Order Nation (NON) has taken over your country, your neighborhood, and
your life.  No Voice.  No Choice.  No Games.  No Music.

Forget that! And remember, Music is the Weapon.  (tm)

In this 3-player simultaneous game, you are part of Revolution-X, and you and
two Xer's are on your way to see Aerosmith at Club-X.  However, on your way
there, you happen to notice a NON assault chopper.  Time to pull out your
handy-dandy machine pistol and trusty CD's of death.  After attacking the
chopper, the game announces that "Revolution X has begun."

Make your way to Club-X by blasting the various troopers.  You can decide which
way you want to go at some points, as indicated by what seems like a CD control
panel.  Don't forget to collect more CD's and other items such as the death
head (like the smart bomb in T2: The Arcade Game, but with a much better
effect).  Oh yeah, you know what they said about music being the weapon? The
CD's are your side weapons in this adventure, and it is heavily suggested that
you collect 'em all (also a tm).  They come in handy against heavily shielded
troopers.

At Club-X, you'll find more troopers, so (obviously) you'll want to spill more
blood there (oh yeah, shoot them, and these guys bleed! MK fans will love this
one..now can we send them birthday cakes and flowers too?? :)

Rev.  X has excellent graphics and sound (thanks to DCS).  The cabinet to big,
so no one should be scrounging for room.  The gun is accurate, and the use of
CD's as a super weapon is original.  However, many of it's elements are similar
to T2:TAG.  One nice touch is that if you are being hit, you'll know--a big
"HIT" sign lights up above your life meter indicating it.  Overall, it's worth
the 50 cents to start, but not to continue.

Ace - 80       'Eh'.  Nice attempt at a T2 follow-up, but it's too much of the
               same.  Granted, choosing your path was a nice feature, as was
               the nice Aerosmith backgrounds - but where was "Eat the Rich" or
               "Crazy?"  Oh well.. lets bring Hammer out!  [You know, the
               rapper?  Never mind..]

    or a full review (4 to 10 paragraphs).  For other articles, please
    write for more info.

 Q: Hey!  These people stole my codes - I wanna sue!
 A: Our policy is to publish all codes we find.  If you happen to find
    them too that's nice - that does NOT mean that we didn't also.
    Just to be on the safe side, however, we are publishing a "these
    people too" list is we see codes posted on the Net before our issue
    comes out.
    OR, you can email them to US and _not_ post them.. you could win
    something!

 Q: Where can I get this FAQ, how often is is posted and updated?
 A: GMJ-FAQ comes out every Thursday, in the rec.games.video newsgroups, as
 well as in alt.games.mk and alt.games.sf2; you can also find it in our FTP
 site [see above.]  The FAQ is updated as needed.

 New online service to bring many SNES, Genesis users on-line

 LOS ANGELES, CA (GMJ) - The Catapult system aims to launch gamers into
 cyberspace, allowing for head-to-head, cross-country competition.

 Using pre-existing software, the Catapult uses a Game Genie-like
 software-interception technique to tell the Super NES or Genesis to treat the
 Catapult modem as the second (or 3rd and/or 4th) controller.  You plug the
 game into the modem, the modem into the SNES or Genesis, and when you turn it
 on, it dials an 800 number automatically.  While the system downloads the
 information needed to play the game you have selected, you are presented with
 a small on-screen newsletter relating to the game.  (For instance an NBA Jam
 tournament announcement, for Jam players.)

 Once that info is set, you log-in as your 'character', as real names are not
 used on the system.  The computer will then match you up with players of
 similar ability, and if you choose, are not long-distance.

 What this means is two cross-town friends can play NBA Jam in each of their
 own homes with nothing apparent happening.

 One feature that will make this system great is the ability to keep overall
 records for later use.  Catapult saves who won and lost, adding and
 subtracting from your ranking (for instance, if you played NBA Jam you would
 start as a high-school player, and move up to HS starter, college player,
 1st-round draft choice, bencher, player, starter, star and super star.)
 Multiple records are kept for each member of the family (up to 4 can be a
 member on one subscription) and for each game played.

 Virtually all pre-existing multi-player Super NES and Genesis games can be
 supported with no modification ofthe game's program, which impressed many
 people at the Summer CES, where it debuted.

 "I can't wait to play NHL when this gets going," said one Sega PR rep.

 Companies are very supportive of the Catapult because games do not need to be
 designed with the network specifically in mind.  Nintendo, Sega and Acclaim
 all support the system, with Capcom soon to follow.

 Phone-fatalities, anyone?  (Would those be phonalities?)

 The system will cost $5 to $10 a month, depending on the payment plan
 selected.  Parents can restrict usage by certain members of the family to
 Weekends Only, or any time of day they want, so the phone line isn't tied up
 too long.  There is also a long-distance toggle, preventing people from
 calling out-of-area to play Mortal Kombat, for instance.

 Other features on the network include: a simple email system [using either a
 PC keyboard or hunt-and-pecking with the controller], post in simple news
 areas, and check the rankings of other players in the area and the country.

 TNT continues to be the least expensive comprehensive provider of game
 information for individual game systems.  While CES video tapes (covering
 specific systems or the show in general) will cost you between $15 and $25
 with shipping costs, TNT costs only $6.00 for basic show coverage and $11 for
 both basic coverage and your choice of game system packages, total -- no
 shipping cost in the USA! 19 writers will be contributing to TNT, ensuring the
 maximum quantity of gaming news for the dollar.

 **     Get Your Hands On The Single Best Summer CES Resource Available!    **
 *****************************************************************************

      Think back six months or a year to the last time you read a CES report
 on the Internet. Remember all the people who said they would show up and
 post a series of reports with everything they saw? Most of them never did.
 After Summer CES '93, Renegade Technologies Unlimited came back with answers
 to questions asked by Internet gamers and followed up by unleashing hundreds
 of pages of text including question-and-answer sessions with the Internet
 gaming public, a list of every game shown with ratings/comments, digitized
 photographs and even sound files from then-unreleased games such as Street
 Fighter II Champion Edition for the Genesis. After Winter CES '94, we
 coordinated online interviews with show participants and made their
 transcripts available within 24 hours.
      Now we're shining our shoes and ironing our clothes in preparation for
 the 1994 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. Less than a month from today
 (June 23-25), 19 TNT staffers will take to the show floors of McCormick Place
  and bring back incredible insights into the next year of video game products.
 You read it correctly, "insights." Not just some guy summarizing Virtua
 Fighters in one-syllable words; we're talking about pages of solid text and
 pictures devoted to bringing home the whole story behind the SCES.
      TNT (The Next Thing) magazine was conceived as the end-all-be-all of
 SCES coverage, combining audio, video and written reports in an effort to
 save the average gamer $500+ on airfare and hotel accommodations. We do all
 the footwork, we ask all the questions, and we burn ourselves out. You sit
 at home playing video games and receive a big envelope in the mail. It's
 simple and it will work -- just ask any of the people who have already
 subscribed to TNT about our high quality customer service. One issue only,
 no continuing obligations, arriving in mid-July... but read on.
      Take a look back at some of your old game magazines. How much CES
 coverage did you find? 10 pages? Maybe 15 at best? That's not coverage, that's
 shameful -- this is a 3-day event with hundreds of exhibitors, and everyone
 has something interesting to show. Ever wonder why the major gaming mags
 can only squeeze a few pages of information out of a show that lasts for
 three or four days? Answer: Their "writers" don't pay much attention. Snap a
 picture, make up a 30-word synopsis, and that's what the game was like at CES.
      The high-quality TNT magazine will be a hardcopy printed booklet with
 many pages devoted to the show's general highlights and notable events. The
 magazine will feature sections devoted to showing the best games (regardless
 of system) in each major genre, a look at the keynote speech by Nintendo's
 Howard Lincoln, and some beautiful artwork by TNT's own Russell Kumro. For
 the reader's maximum enjoyment, additional computer disks [available in IBM
 and Macintosh formats] will carry photographs (and perhaps digitized sound
 files) from the show, highlighting each major hardware-producer's licensees
 and displays. Does TNT sound like it will kill your pocketbook? It won't,
 because we designed the magazine around four principles to be flexible enough
 to accommodate many types of readers.

 [*] Flexibility: [*]   Today's gamer owns two or three systems and generally
                        despises competing companies. Do you own a 3DO and hate
                        Atari and their Jaguar? Or a Genesis and hate Nintendo?
                        Well, don't spend the money on information you'll just
                        skip anyway. The TNT magazine is available in
                        your choice of configurations -- you pick the systems
                        you want and we'll send you the appropriate disks and
                        printed materials.

 [*] Cost-Efficiency: [*]   The printed TNT magazine with CES highlights will
                            cost only $6.00, a better value than what you would
                            get (a crappy five-page synopsis) in the average
                            mainstream magazine. Each company-specific set of
                            disks and additional printed materials will cost
                            an additional $5.00, and a disk of miscellaneous 			
                            photos and out-takes will be only $4.00.  That 			
                            miscellaneous disk will include pictures from 			
                            companies like Sony, TTI and Commodore (if any 			
                            of them show up for CES).  We're selling 			 Atari,
                            Nintendo, Sega and 3DO company disks which 			 will
                            include the aforementioned companies' 			 licensees
                            as well.  If you want to buy the whole 			
                            compendium of CES information, the price is $26.

 [*] Functionality: [*]   IBM or Macintosh disks will be included with
                           each company-specific or miscellaneous/outtakes- disk
                           order.  The photographs will be in a format maximized
                           for compression and photo quality.  You'd be amazed
                           at how much high resolution detail we were able to
                           squeeze into the last Summer CES photos; more,
                           believe it or not, than could be seen without a
                           magnifying glass.  The printed magazine can be kept
                           on your desk, framed above your fireplace or used as
                           a security blanket.  Regardless of what you do with
                           it, it'll look cool and contain entertaining insights
                           into the real nature of the CES show.

 [*] Quick Delivery: [*]   Here's the best part. Waiting sucks and no one knows
                           it better than Team Renegade and you.  We're making a
                           guarantee that TNT will be released at a *maximum* of
                           three weeks after CES.  We're going to try for two
                           weeks or less, but we can't control everything.
                           Remember, we're not talking about just printing
                           regurgitated press releases and press kit photos;
                           you'll see the former on the Internet within a day of
                           release to the media.  TNT will feature the types of
                           nook and cranny questions no one seems to ask.

      Renegade Technologies Unlimited is committed to the production of an
 exceptional piece of journalism. The TNT magazine will be both comprehensive
 and professionally produced, delivered faster than the major magazines and
 far more insightful for certain. RTU will be maintaining a professional
 set of records for those who order TNT in advance and we make an absolute
 guarantee that if we cannot deliver the product we will instantly refund
 your money. Additionally, if Sega and their licensees have no presence at
 the CES (which is quite doubtful), we'll refund the cost of the Sega-specific
 diskettes.

 Bytes. You'll appreciate our devotion to customer satisfaction and the degree

 after the Summer CES... and next time someone promises that they'll ask your
 questions and bring you the answers, remember who did it first and who does
 it best.

        Macintosh or IBM disk(s), circle your choice.
