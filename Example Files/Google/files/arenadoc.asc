                        THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA
                                 

        Welcome to the world of Tamriel, known by its inhabitants as
the Arena. This is a glimpse at what awaits you in the Elder 
Scrolls: over four hundred towns, twelve million square kilometers of
cities and wilderness, and more fortresses, dungeons, and crypts than we
can count.



****************************************************************************                   
                   How to Play The Elder Scrolls: Arena
****************************************************************************

On-Screen Buttons
  There are many options that you can invoke while exploring the
  world of Tamriel. To the right of your character's face are two rows of
  buttons. The button and the action it represents are explained in the
  following list:

     Mouse GENERAL CONTROLS
                 Left clicking while cursor is an arrow
                 will move you in the direction of the arrow.
                 The further the arrow is from the center of the
                 screen, the faster you will move.

                 Left clicking an object while the cursor is an
                 'X' interacts with it, the interaction depends
                 upon whether you are in 'talk', 'cast', or
                 'attack' mode. (see below)

                 Right clicking while left mouse button is depressed 
                 will cause you to jump.

                 Right clicking an object while cursor is an 'X' 
                 identifies it, if it is not generic.


     Crossed Swords icon - ATTACK
                 Clicking this will draw your weapon and put you
                 in attack mode. From here holding down the left
                 mouse button moves you in the same direction as
                 the arrow. Holding down the right mouse button
                 and moving the mouse swings your weapon. You
                 may still jump using the 'J' key. Shift+J will
                 do a standing long jump. Clicking this icon
                 again will sheath your weapon.

     Sunburst icon - CAST
                 Cast a spell. Left clicking the icon will cause
                 your spellbook to appear. You may pick the
                 spell you wish to cast, and the target of that
                 spell.
                 To save time in recasting the same spell, you
                 can right click the icon again. If you have the
                 spell points, you will cast the last chosen
                 spell again.

     Fingers picking gold icon - STEAL
                 Steal something. When this icon is clicked a
                 prompt will come up asking, "Target?". Pick the
                 target on the screen. If it is a person, there
                 will be an attempt to pickpocket him or her. If it is
                 a barrier, such as a chest or door, an attempt
                 will be made to unlock it. 

     Hand grabbing icon - USE
                 Use something. When this icon is clicked an
                 inventory of usable magic items will come up.
                 Pick the item you wish to use and then follow
                 any onscreen prompts that may arise, such as
                 "Target?" for a ring spell. Note: Only from the
                 3D walk-around menu can you use an item. If you
                 want to use a healing potion, you must use it
                 from here, as you will be unable to use it from
                 the character sheet.

     Snake-staff icon - PLAYER STATUS
                 Player Status. Clicking this icon will pause the
                 game and show your current status, and other
                 items such as the date and time of day, or any
                 reputational issues that may affect your status
                 at your current location. Other information on
                 this pop up will be your current condition,
                 health, spells that are currently affecting
                 you, and spells that are currently active.

     Parchment with lines icon - LOGBOOK
                 This icon represents the 'Logbook', a journal of
                 your travels. This feature is deactivated for the
                 demo.

     Campfire icon - CAMP
                 Camp icon. Left clicking this icon will cause
                 you to rest. During rest you will slowly regain
                 lost hit points, spell points, and fatigue. You
                 may camp anywhere outside a city's walls. You
                 may not camp inside a city unless you have
                 purchased or snuck into a room in a tavern and
                 are currently inside the tavern where you have
                 that room. The amount you heal per hour of rest
                 is greatly affected by where you sleep. The
                 nicer the accommodation (ie...expensive), the
                 more you will heal per hour.

     Automap icon - AUTOMAP / CONTINENTAL MAP
                 Left clicking Map icon:
                 Left clicking this icon will bring up your
                 automap parchment, upon which will be inscribed
                 all the places you have currently visited. Pay
                 close attention to this map, it may be the only
                 thing to provide you clues when searching for
                 something.
                 You can make notes on the map by left
                 clicking the map where you wish to place the
                 note and then typing. Hit 'Enter' to get
                 back the pen or right click the mouse
                 button. You can erase notes by clicking the
                 line you wish to erase and then hitting the
                 'ESC' key.
                 Left clicking the compass points on the automap
                 will scroll the map so you can see a larger
                 area. Left clicking the center of the compass
                 will center the map on your location. As a
                 note, any locations that are marked
                 automatically by the automap, (ie not by you)
                 will be left of the first character in the
                 sentence. Therefore an inn that is marked on
                 your automap will be to the left of the first
                 character in its name.

                 Right clicking Map icon:
                 Right clicking the Automap icon in the game will 
                 bring up the Continental Map, from which you can 
                 travel to other cities, towns, or villages. This
                 feature is deactivated in the demo.

          ESC key - SETUP MENU
                 Setup menu. This will pause the game and bring
                 up an option menu from which you will be able
                 to do the following:
                 1) Play saved game  -  Loads a game from a save
                                   list. Deactivated in the demo.
                 2) Save game      - Save the current game.
                                   Deactivated in the demo.
                 3) Detail         - Helpful for speeding up
                                   gameplay on slower machines.
                                   Adjust the detail level to
                                   minimum to maximize the speed.
                 4) Sound          - Allows you to increase or
                                     decrease sound effects.
                 5) Music          - Allows you to increase or
                                     decrease the volume of the
                                     music.
                 6) Drop to DOS    - Drops out of the game and
                                     into the world of DOS.
                 7) Continue       - Exits back to Arena.

     Character portrait - CHARACTER SHEET
                 Clicking your name/face along the bottom row
                 in the game will bring up your Character sheet, 
                 from which many options are available. This is
                 deactivated in the demo.

MOUSE CONTROLS
The mouse is your direct interface to the world of Arena. You
will use it to define actions or choices while exploring the
land. As you look at the screen, you will notice that the mouse
cursor can change into one of 10 cursors, either an arrow, a 
sword, or an 'X'. When the mouse is an arrow and the left mouse 
button is depressed, you will walk in
the direction designated by that arrow cursor. The further
towards the edge of your screen the arrow gets, the faster you
will walk. When the arrow is a sword, it is used to pick or click
icons on the walkaround menu. When the arrow is an 'X', whatever
is under the 'X' will be interacted with, depending upon what
mode you are in. For further explanations, see The 'X' below.
Jumping is accomplished by clicking the right mouse button while
the left mouse button is being depressed. If you are standing
still at the time you will jump straight up. If you are running
you will do a running broad jump. The distance you can jump is
determined by your Strength, and the Speed at which you were
running. Since characters with a higher Speed rating can run
faster, they will also be able to jump farther.

The 'X'
Placing your 'X' cursor on a monster or door and right clicking
will identify the monster or store. Therefore, placing the cursor
on an equipment store's door and right clicking will display the
equipment store's name, and will inscribe that name onto your
automap for future reference.

While the cursor is an 'X' you can manipulate your environment:
Placing the 'X' on another person and clicking your left mouse
button will allow you to talk to them, pickpocket them, or cast a
spell at them, depending upon what mode your cursor is in.
(Normal, Steal, Cast)
Placing the 'X' on a door or chest will display your assessment
of the lock, or allow you to try and unlock it, depending upon
what mode your are in. (Normal, Steal)
Placing the 'X' on treasure and left clicking will give you a
picklist of the treasure available for you to pick up.

Consult the previous section on Onscreen buttons to get a
detailed description of how each is accomplished.
