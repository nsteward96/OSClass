   YES, YES, YES!!!!  It's finally finished! It's 6 AM and I decided to stay
up all night and finish the fanzine are prepare to ship off. Sitting here
with a major headache, a half full can of Pepsi, and a lovely Dunkin Donut's
Boston Cream donut taught me one thing about sugar-saturated food...Chocolate
cream, vanilla cream, and soda.....aye yie yie!

   This fanzine was originally going to be printed on paper and mailed out
like a regular fanzine/prozine, but hey, I got tired of spending more for
supplies than I gain with subscription money. This is the best way, for me,
anyway.

   With the not-so-long-ago release of the Jaguar and the Panasonic 3DO, it
makes you wonder if the public is really ready for such high-tech mounds of
machinery. The Genesis and Super NES are just barely showing off the climax
of the 16-bit era, and already competition is starting for 32/64 bit
machines.

   When the Jaguar/3DO news first spread, everyone asked where Nintendo and
Sega where in the line. The way things look, both companies are being
incredibly smart. I think that Sega is learning from Nintendo, honestly. It
seems estimated that only 25% of the industry is CD-ROM based. That's where
the 3DO fails when it comes to sales.  50% to 60% is stuck in the 16-bit
SNES/Genny zone. That's where Atari is hurting is Jaguar sales, and 15% to
25% of the industry is still trapped in the 8-bit NES phase. (We all know
how badly the NES is dying.)  Now putting these figures into consideration,
if you were bringing out a new system, the obvious choice is to try to stay
in the 16-bit area where the sales are.  With the hype Panasonic and Atari
are pulling, the 3DO and Jaguar WILL gain popularity...but very slowly. As
soon as the percentage of the higher "bittage" or CD-ROM industry climbs,
that is when Sega and Nintendo will jump in that arena. Sega- possibly at
the end of this year and Nintendo with arcade machines at the end of the year
and a home unit next year.  At first, it seemed to look like Nintendo was
planning a late entry as always, but in my opinion, they are right on
schedule when it comes to sales and popularity of higher end machines.

   For all younger kids reading this fanzine, it is rated MA-13. Do not
continue reading this fanzine without adult permission! Ah what the heck,
okay you can read the fanzine, little ones. (kidding)

   You probably already paged down 1000 times already typing to see what else
is in the fanzine. That makes it pretty much pointless to tell you what's in
the issue. But if you haven't, make sure you at least glance at the interview
I held with our very own Nintendo guy. You MIGHT catch something new in that
interview I held with him at the beginning of January. Also, we want you to
help continue that interview.  Send in any questions you have that are of
public interest and I'll be sure to ask those questions for next issue!

                            ---NINTENDO EXPOSED---
                    INTERVIEW WITH NINTENDO REPRESENTATIVE

This interview was taken at the beginning of January with a personal friend
of the family who works for Nintendo of America.  As you may find out, the
answers to the questions are not at all like the Nintendo Reps you reach on
the phone.  This Nintendo employee is one of only a few actual programmers/
tech. support employees at Nintendo of America.

GG: Just to start off, can you please tell all the readers your name and
    occupation?

NR: My name is Roger and I am a Nintendo representative in the programming/
    technical support department at Nintendo of America.

GG: How often do you play video games, and what is your background of
    employment?

NR: Playing and testing out video games is part ofd my job. I sit in front of
    this screen several times a day to make sure that everything is perfect.
    Before working for Nintendo, I had another programming and technical
    support job at AT&T in Allentown, Pennsylvania. I was released during a
    layoff after three or four years of working there. Next thing I know, I
    was recommended and I found myself moving here to Washington for my big
    break. I always *loved* to play video games.

GG: Interesting. I'm sure I could just ask you the simple stuff like this for
    the whole interview, but I REALLY want to get to the good stuff, like
    future games, systems, and all that stuff.  Just for their reference what
    have you done so far while being with Nintendo?

NR: Probably 95% of the time I was put in the sound recording/development of
    video games. Not a whole lot of programming goes on in the U.S. base, but
    what ever we do, that's where I am, if I'm assigned to it.  I've been all
    over the place, when it comes to video game sounds. I've been from "Dr.
    Mario" for the Game Boy to "Super Mario kart" for the SNES...having at
    least a *little* bit to do with the sound.

GG: Cool. Okay, fill us in...FX Trax.

NR: FX Trax is not known as that anymore. It has been renamed to Stunt Racer
    FX and will be the next game for the SNES using the Super FX micro-
    processor. it is scheduled for early to mid '94 and is expected to be the
    first 32-meg cartridge for a 16-bit system!

GG: Okay...Super Metroid

NR: I don't have too much information right now, it's also set for mid '94 and
    is expected to be the first 24-meg cartridge for the SNES.

GG: And chance for a new Mario Adventure for ANY system out NOW?

NR: No comment.

GG: Well that gives it away! (laughing) Okay, here are the questions about
    Project Reality that has been on lots of people minds for a while now.
    First of all, is there any sign that you know of that indicates a breaking
    up of Nintendo and Silicon Graphics? This was the major problem for
    Nintendo in the past.

NR: So far, I don't see any kind of breaking up happening. The problem Nintendo
    had in the past...you probably mean with the Super NES CD. Nintendo
    originally signed with Sony to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the SNES.
    As everyone knows, the Sega CD is a Sony product. All I will say is that a
    nice sum of money was exchanged, and the next thing we knew, Sony is off
    with Sega leaving Nintendo in the dust. We had a backup plan, and that was
    with Philips Electronics. Things went perfectly well, and even high-tech
    prototypes were finished and tested. I had the opportunity to test it
    myself in New York City at a special conference. Suddenly Nintendo of Japan
    scrapped the 16-bit CD-ROM add-on and went 32-bit. Philips wanted a new
    machine altogether, but Nintendo wanted an add-on peripheral. Wham bam we
    were back to square one again. Right now, Silicon Graphics and Nintendo
    seem to be working together very well, and we're all pleased. The one thing
    we do NOT like is the fact that Sega came from behind and Pearl harbored
    us by signing with Silicon graphics as well for a future machine of their
    own. Some fear that history's gonna repeat itself, since Sega is back in
    the picture. If money gets exchanged again, we won't be happy campers. But
    I will say that Nintendo DOES have a back up plan if such a thing happens.
    No matter what, NIntendo WILL have a home system for release, weather it be
    from SGI or not.

GG: How about a release date?

NR: No EXACT release date is set for the machine, but Nintendo targets a 3rd
    quarter 1995 release.

GG: Any games you know of coming out for the machine?

NR: Right now, no. But SGI plans to bring out some of their current SGI games
    found in the arcades. Don't forget that at the end of the year, SGI arcade
    machines will be open to the public. We are talking with Argonaut right
    now, hoping they will join the development team.  They helped develop the
    SFX chip, anyway.

GG: Cool beaners. But what the readers want is NEW information, not stuff they
    can read in the magazines. Spill your guts!!

NR: naturally, I am limited to what i can say, Mike, but I will give it a shot.
    A SNES version of Super Street Fighter 2 is in the works, and also a MK2
    is set for the SNES!  Right now, 5 games using the SFX chip are under
    development, besides Stunt Racer FX.  Releases should begin in the second
    half of the year. And the SFX chip in those games are NOT the same as the
    chip in Star Fox. The new SFX chip is a 21 MHz processor, which helps
    improve on the formula. Some games are Star Fox 2, which should be 32 megs
    and 2-player simultaneous play, Power Slide, Dirt Racer, and Citadel.

GG: Will you be at the Summer CES when Nintendo debuts some new hot games?

NR: I wish! I never made it to a CES yet, but I plan on taking time off to get
    a plane and head for the summer show. Not as a representative, but as any
    other visitor.

GG: Have anything else you would like to add to the interview?

NR: Yeah, I want to say that I appreciate being in your fanzine. Magazines get
    tipped to praise almost every game they review. Fanzines are honest with
    the games they are approached with and aren't afraid to say they suck.
    And as for your old man, I want to publicly call him a traitor (as a
    joke). AT&T is now working with Sega to make that modem crap piece..what
    is it..the Edge 16. Nintendo's future modem/network units in Japan will
    kick ass. I saw the details but I won't tell them just yet.

             PHILIPS CD-I COMES OF AGE AS A GAME MACHINE AND MORE
             CD-I Sales on the Rise Following Infotainment Blitz
                                 Chuck Miller
     
Following a successful holiday commercial blitz, Philips CD-i seems finally to
be gathering momentum as competition heats up with other CD-based platforms
from The 3DO Company, Sega and Commodore. Sales of CD-i players outsold other
CD-based systems during the last quarter of '93 by as much as 18 to 1. This is
significant in a platform that has been slow to catch on. However, 1994 looks
like a good year for CD-i owners, especially those interested in gaming.
                                        
--I Like Your Figure
  
According to figures presented by Philips at a special press event held at the
Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES), there are currently 300,000 CD-i
units in consumers' hands. The goal for '94 is to bring the total number of
units sold to 1,000,000! If this is reached, CD-i will be established at a
viable growth point to insure its continued success. From the quality of titles
shown at WCES, and based upon the newer value priced players being offered,
this goal looks attainable. The reason for this growth is that Philips is
finally pushing CD-i as an entertainment system, rather than as an edutainment
and infotainment product only.
                            
--Like, I Dig Your Hardware, Man
  
The cost of CD-i ownership has just dropped significantly with two new units
being offered by Philips and Magnavox. The Philips CD-i 220 Player, supplied
with a wireless remote Thumbstick controller, retails for $499. The Magnavox
unit, the CD-i 200 Player, comes with the same remote for $399. Both accept
Philips Digital Video Cartridge (DVC) providing full screen, full motion
video for $249.95. Offering a new level of video quality in CD-i games and
making access to Video CD and music videos a simple affair, the DVC is a must
have accessory. At present, 30 movies are available on CD with hundreds more
on the way from Paramount and MGM.
                                     
--Being in Full Control

In addition to the included remote, several other controllers are available.
Of course, there's that large, gaudy Roller Controller designed for kids.
However, several other devices are more worthy add-ons. New is the Touchpad, a
joypad similar to those accompanying game consoles (it looks almost identical
to the Gravis PC Gamepad) that is ideal for action titles. Two Touchpads can
be used at one time for multiplayer games. Also new is the Trackerball, a
trackball variation, and the Mouse and Mouse Pad. Still in development is a
handy wireless remote gun controller, ideal for titles like Mad Dog McCree.
  
--It's All Fair Game
  
Of course, of greatest interest to us is the quality and quantity of game
titles in the works. Though games for CD-i are not as plentiful as those for
PC CD-ROM, there is still a large body of exciting titles in development with
some presently available. Titles you can nab right now (with some set to ship
imminently) include: Voyeur, Kether, Inca, Caesars World of Boxing, Inter-
national Tennis Open, Escape from Cybercity, Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda:
The Wand of Gamelon, Mystic Midway: Rest in Pieces, Battleship, Alice in
Wonderland, and Alien Gate. Many more titles are due to ship over the next few
months.
  
--Brought to You by DVC
  
Several key games titles to watch for on CD-i require the new Digital Video
Cartridge. These are: Mad Dog McCree, The 7th Guest, Space Ace, Microcosm,
and Litil Devil. Of these games, Mad Dog, Microcosm and 7th Guest are the most
visually stunning. The quality of the full screen, full motion video is
unsurpassed on any CD platform at present. There is simply no comparison with
the smoothness of movement and picture image that these CD-i titles provide.
Yes, there is the additional cost of the DVC module, but the quality of game
play is worth it. Besides, having the DVC will allow you to view Video CD
movies.
  
--And the Titles Keep Rolling By
  
One other game shown in early development was Creature Shock. This title,
featuring full 3D rendered graphics (of 3D Studio quality), was absolutely
amazing. An action/adventure title, Creature Shock is the kind of game that
will sell CD-i players. It looks that good! Yet, there are quality titles in
development the DO NOT require the DVC. One in particular is Zelda's Quest.
With the feel and game play of the original NES Legend of Zelda, this game
will capture many gamers with its photorealistic imagery and design similarity
to the aforementioned title. Zelda fans will find this title a must addition
to their game library.
 
--What the Future Holds
  
Of course, the future of CD-i, and all the new platforms, is dependent on the
percentage of market share gained and the overall acceptance of the platform
by consumers. Though it is next to impossible to pick a winner in the CD-based
player market at present, I believe that CD-i has as good a chance as any of
succeeding, and a better chance than most. Time will certainly tell. However,
if I were to buy any system right now (CD-i, 3DO, CD32, Sega CD/CDX, or
Jaguar), dollar-for-dollar, I would probably go for CD-i. Still, I think I'll
wait just a bit longer and see what develops by Summer of '94 at the Summer
Consumer Electronics Show.

                              ATARI STRIKES BACK
                64-bit Jaguar Unleashed on Video Gaming Public
                                  Jeff James

Once the dominant force in video gaming, Atari has had to sit on the sidelines
and watch Sega and Nintendo fight it out for the hearts, and allowance money,
of video gamers the world over. Now, after years of inactivity in the video
gaming market (with the exception of the Lynx handheld), Atari returns with a
new 64-bit video game system: the Jaguar. Using a 64-bit data bus and multiple
RISC processors, the Jaguar leaps past current 16-bit systems.
                                      
--Enter the Jaguar!
  
According to Atari Communications Director Bob Brodie, the Jaguar ($249 retail)
is was test marketed in 2 areas for the Christmas 1993 season: New York and San
Francisco. Only 50,000 Jaguars will be produced for the 4th Quarter of 1993,
with Atari planning to ramp up production dramatically in 1994. Brodie said
that an "extraordinarily limited number" of Jaguars will be available at the
Incredible Universe superstore in Dallas, TX. For consumers outside of those
markets, Brodie mentioned that a limited supply of Jaguars will be made
available via Atari's customer service department.

--Tom and Jerry
  
So what makes the Jaguar so special? If the Jaguar's 64-bit bus is what gives
it fast "legs," the custom graphics hardware gives the Jag it's bite. There are
5 processors spread across 3 individual chips; the 2 most powerful are named
"Tom" and "Jerry." Tom contains 3 processors: a 32- bit, 27 MIPS graphics
processing unit (GPU), a bit blitter, and an object processor. Tom handles
graphics and animation, and is able to perform complex computer animation tasks
quickly. Jerry consists of 2 processors: a 32-bit RISC chip and a digital
signal processor (DSP) for 16-bit, CD-quality stereo audio.

--A Need for Speed
  
Finally, Tom and Jerry are joined by a 13.3 MHz Motorola 68000 processor which
acts as a general purpose control processor. All of this custom graphics hard-
ware is tied together with a 64-bit data bus, which Atari claims will support
a data throughput of an astonishing 106.4 Megabytes per second. The combination
of a speedy data bus with multiple RISC processors gives the Jaguar the ability
to display 24-bit true-color images with up to 16.7 million colors. Atari also
claims that Jaguar can perform more than 850 million pixel changes per second,
compared to the 3DO's 64 million and 1 million each for the SNES and Genesis.

--Hardware Heroics
  
The Jaguar also features some advanced hardware-based animation capabilities,
comparable to those found in Panasonic's 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Support
is included for: texture mapping (wrapping an image on a 3D object);
transparency (for realistic glass, smoke and fog effects); morphing (a la'
Terminator 2); warping (for the quick twisting and distortion of objects);
and light sourcing (for realistic shading and lighting effects). All of these
animation capabilities combine to give the Jaguar the processing muscle to move
and animate graphic objects smoothly and quickly.

--The Packing List
  
The Jaguar comes with one cartridge slot; using an image compression technique
known as "JagPEG" (a variation on the JPEG compression format), programmers can
squeeze up to 6 Megabytes (48 Megabits) of program data onto a single Jaguar
cartridge. Cartridge data can be loaded into the main memory of the Jaguar,
which consists of 2 Megabytes (16 Megabits) of main system RAM. One 17-button
controller and a cartridge game Cybermorph (developed by Attention to Detail)
are also included. There are 2 controller ports included, and a ComLynx I/O
port allows players to connect several Jaguars (or Atari Lynxes) for multi-
machine, multi-player games.

--The Expanding Universe (Jaguar Peripherals)
  
Brodie says that Atari will ship a multi-spin CD-ROM drive for the Jaguar
"after mid-1994." The CD-ROM drive, projected to be in the $200 range, will
offer support for music CDs, CD+Gs, Kodak Photo CDs and Jaguar CD games.
Brodie also mentioned that a forthcoming MPEG-II cartridge would allow the
Jaguar to support the new Video CD format, which packs 74 minutes of VHS-
quality video on a standard compact disk. Atari also plans to introduce a
Virtual Reality headset and a high-speed serial interface (to allow players to
play games over standard telephone lines) in late 1994 or early 1995.

--Starting Small
  
According to Brodie, only 4 cartridges were available and shipping for the
Jaguar by the end of November: Cybermorph (bundled with the system), Trevor
McFur in the Crescent Galaxy (Atari), Raiden (Imagitec Design), and Evolution:
Dino Dudes (Imagitec Design). Tiny Toon Adventures (Atari) and Checkered Flag
II (Rebellion Software) were to have been available before Christmas 1993. More
titles are coming in 1994, including: Club Drive (Atari), Alien vs. Predator
(Rebellion Software), Kasumi Ninja (Atari), Tempest 2000 (Atari), Battlezone
2000 (Atari), Steel Talons (Atari) and Sports Games (Atari).

--Bubsy, Barkley, and Brett Hull
  
Although the current selection of Jaguar games is decidedly sparse, several
notable software developers have promised support for the Jaguar. ID Software
(creator of the popular Wolfenstein-3D for MS-DOS computers) is planning to
port their forthcoming Doom game to the Jaguar sometime in 1994. Accolade has
announced that it will develop five games for the Jaguar in 1994, including Al
Michaels Announces Hardball III, Brett Hull Hockey, Bubsy: Claws Encounters of
the Furred Kind, Charles Barkley Basketball, and Jack Nicklaus Power Challenge
Golf.
  
--Return to Zork, Spock
  
Adventure game publisher Activision is planning to bring out a version of
Return to Zork for the Jaguar CD in 1994, with a possible conversion of
Mechwarrior II: The Clans to follow. Interplay (developer of Battle Chess and
Star Trek: The 25th Anniversary for MS-DOS computers) is gearing up to produce
a CD title (possibly Battle Chess) for the Jaguar CD under the Atari label.
     
This list of developers is a small one, and most of the games will be released
in mid-to-late 1994. A more difficult challenge may be convincing consumers
that Atari is in for the long-term to support the Jaguar.

--Pricing to Ponder
  
Although the Jaguar's $250 retail price places it well with in the price range
of prospective SNES and Sega buyers, the addition of the $200 Jaguar CD-ROM
drive will push the Jaguar squarely into the price range of Commodore's Amiga
CD32 ($399) and a few hundred dollars under Panasonic's $699 REAL 3DO system.
The CD32 has been selling strongly in the UK and Europe over the past few
months, backed by a lengthy list of talented UK developers. And with new 3DO
players set to arrive from Sanyo and AT&T over the coming months, market
pressure should drive the price of a 3DO compatible system into the $500 price
range.

--CES: Brawling for Bucks and Bits
  
Atari announced nationwide distribution of the Jaguar at the Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) in January. Commodore unveiled the Amiga CD32 to the
U.S. market at the same show, and the 3DO company showed a promotional push as
well. Phillips has repriced their CDI (Compact Disk Interactive) system to
$499, and the two juggernauts of the video game industry, Sega and Nintendo,
will be promoting their 16-bit video game systems. What the Genesis and Super
NES lack in hardware specs will be more than compensated by their commanding
market presence, for now.

--Sleeping Giants

As the sleeping giants of the video game industry, Sega and Nintendo aren't
about to rest on their laurels. Both are planning to introduce new game systems
in late 1994 or early 1995. Sega is reportedly developing a 32-bit CD-based
game system (code-named "Saturn"), while Nintendo has joined forces with work-
station manufacturer Silicon Graphics to begin work on an advanced game system
with the nebulous moniker of "Project Reality." Although both systems are still
at least a year away, they do serve as a reminder that neither company intends
to surrender the multi-billion dollar home video game market without a fight.

--Predictions
  
Although it's too early to tell if the Jaguar will help Atari reassume it's
once lofty position in the video game market, the Jaguar does lay down a
gauntlet for Sega and Nintendo to follow. Regardless of which system is
eventually declared the "best," video game consumers will be the real winners,
rewarded with lower prices, more powerful game systems, and new games which
will truly take gaming "to the next level." For more information on the Jaguar,
contact Atari at 408-745-8852.

                                 Alan Emrich
     
Since 1990, Computer Gaming World has been writing editorials in its pages
urging the industry to monitor the violence in its games. We have stressed the
need for computer game producers to establish a voluntary "ratings system" for
their games, labeling them on the package for sexual situation, violence,
occult subjects, and so forth. Allow me elaborate and express my own concerns.

--Big Brother is Censoring You?
  
Typically, the collective computer game industry chose to ignore the potential
problem of game ratings until it became a crisis (by definition, a crisis is
when you can't say "Let's forget the whole thing"). Literally, the hour before
congressional hearings were to begin the major video game manufacturers
announced a joint agreement that they would self-regulate new standards in
rating their own products for material that might not be suited for some
consumers (particularly young children). That didn't cancel the CSPAN circus
with Nintendo and SEGA taking shots at each other, but the crisis, for the time
being, has been averted.

--The Great Debate
  
What many computer gamers with access to on-line networks such as PRODIGY have
been arguing of late is, what are the implications vis-a-vis the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States? Is this a freedom of speech
issue? Are violent or otherwise "harmfully" explicit computer games tantamount
to pornography? Should they be censored? Should the government regulate them as
they do the airwaves on television and radio?

The answer seems simple. Explicit computer games cannot be banned. Even if they
were pornography (which they're not), they'd still be protected by the First
Amendment.

--Then What Do We Do With Violent Video Games?
  
Computer games are most akin to movie entertainment. They're not free and a
person must make an effort to acquire and play one. Movies have long regulated
themselves away from government censorship through the MPAA ratings systems. We
are all familiar with PG-Rated movies, films with R-Ratings, and so forth.

While some consider even that to be censorship, I don't. To me, I see it as
input -- information to help me, the consumer, make the most informed purchase
decision that I can for myself and my family. I see a rating as nothing but a
3-letter review of a film's explicit content.

--Who'll Stop the Reign?
  
Apparently, the reign of violent or other graphically explicit video and
computer games has been noticed in the unreality that is Washington, DC.
Typically, seeing our nation's leaders hold up a video game laser gun input
device as something "new" and threatening made me want to laugh and cry at the
same time. Our family's Magnavox Oddesy video game unit (can you say Pong?),
back in the 70's, had a "gun" input device, for goodness sake! This is hardly
a new technology. And if its effects are so detrimental, why am I writing this
instead of planning and committing heinous acts of violence against society? I
think I know the answer...

--Knowing Fake Real from Real Real
  
Imagine a cartoon cat. Pick any one you like: Tom, Sylverster, Top Cat (am I
showing my age, or what?). Now think back at some of their cartoon antics. Some
of them were downright violent, wouldn't you say?
  
Now picture a household cat. Here, kitty, kitty. It plays, sleeps, meows, eats
and does other natural feline things, right? So, a child grows up with both in
his living room, Tom (of Tom and Jerry fame) and Fluffy, the household cat.
  
--Okay, so here's the $36 question:
  
Why is it that people don't believe that a child can suspend their disbelief
to enjoy a cartoon? Children know how real cats behave -- that they don't talk,
for instance, or blow up mice with bombs and guns. If a child does, it is far
more likely to be a problem with the child than with the medium of cartoons.
     
Then why do people assume that when kids play games with Kung-Fu-Kick-'Em-In-
The-Crotch action that they will grow up thinking that is how you are supposed
to greet total strangers? Kids see others shake hands and exchange hugs, as a
rule, not roundhouse kick total strangers on the street.

--How Do You Stop the Kids from Playing Them?
  
What bothers me about this whole tempest in a teapot is that while, yes, the
game producers would be acting responsibly to provide consumers some game
rating information, there is no reason for the government to intervene. As it
is with movies, it is the {parents} who are responsible for their child's
upbringing, not congress. Parents must teach their children right from wrong,
instill values in them, show them love and nurture them to be good people and
citizens. Parents are responsible for what their kids watch and play, not
congress. This is a private family matter, not one of the nation's future
mental health.

--Relax
  
I believe that a rating system for computer games would be a "good thing." It
will help consumers (particularly parents) make informed buying decisions.
Having congress usurp parental responsibility, however, is not a good thing.
If congress would start treating parents as adult human beings, rather than
entities whose votes and taxes they try to get more and more of, we could all
take care of ourselves just fine, thank you very much.

                     MORE  THAN 200 TITLES IN DEVELOPMENT

   The 3DO Company today announced plans to launch the 3DO Interactive Multi-
player system worldwide in 1994 with multiple hardware manufacturers as
partners.  At the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES), 3DO said the
library of software titles for the 3DO system continues to grow. Eighteen
software titles are currently available in stores nationwide, more than 200
titles are in development, and the company anticipates that more than 100 new
titles will ship in 1994.  Twenty-three 3DO licensees showcased 43 titles at
WCES. (See below list.) AT&T unveiled three 3DO products for U.S. distribution
in the fall: a CD-based 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system; the VoiceSpan
adapter that connects to any 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system, so users can
play software titles remotely with other players while talking over regular
telephone lines; and a 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system with built-in AT&T
VoiceSpan capabilities.  Sanyo announced plans to release a 3DO system in
Japan later this year, and said it is evaluating the timing of its U.S.launch.
3DO also announced the creation of a software ratings system designed to
provide consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions
when purchasing software.  Titles for the 3DO system are expected to begin
carrying the 3DO-designed ratings symbols in March 1994.

"We're well positioned to set the next consumer electronics standard and 1994
will be our year to make significant progress in reaching that goal," said
Trip Hawkins, president and CEO, The 3DO Company. "Our mission in 1993 was to
capture the beach; we had an ambitious set of goals and we accomplished
everything we set out to do." The REAL 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system,
launched by Panasonic in October 1993, is currently sold through more than
2,000 retail outlets nationwide. 3DO anticipates that four brands of the
CD-based system will be available by fall of this year. "Consumer response to
3DO has been outstanding. The 'innovators' - consumers who appreciate new
levels of performance and the interactivity provided by the 3DO system - have
confirmed that we have a winner," Hawkins added. The CD-based 3DO system will
be available in Europe and Japan by the summer, and multiple brands will be
distributed through more than 30,000 retail outlets worldwide by fall.  The
3DO Company, which formed 3DO Japan in July 1993, will open a European office
this spring to support the growing number of European licensees.  

"3DO is moving rapidly to establish a worldwide standard," Hawkins said. "Our
licensees are confident our technology will succeed in a global market this
year, and we're doing everything we can to support them." Underscoring the
growing support of the software community, more than 100 companies have
become 3DO licensees since the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer came to retail
shelves in October 1993. "Software industry support for 3DO continues to
build," Hawkins said. "3DO has delivered a technology and a way of doing
business that the software industry believes in, and that's why we have the
largest number of companies ever dedicated to a platform. With 3DO, software
companies have the advanced technology they want to develop for and a fair
way of doing business that allows all players to win.  "Our licensees are
investing significant amounts of their own money in 3DO technology, which is
a meaningful vote of confidence for the 3DO platform," Hawkins added.

   The 3DO system delivers a breakthrough in audio and video realism with
interactive software that appeals to the audiences of all ages, bridging the
gap between video game systems and home computers. The 3DO Interactive
Multiplayer system provides up to 50 times the graphics performance of
standard PCs and video game systems. Designed to be a worldwide standard like
VHS, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system also plays music CDs, photo CDs,
and video CDs.  Based in Redwood City, Calif., The 3DO Company (NASDAQ:THDO)
is backed by a unique coalition of partners from consumer electronics,
communications, entertainment and software industries. Investors include
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest manufacturer of
consumer electronics and parent of Panasonic, National, Quasar, and Technics;
AT&T, one the world's leading communications and computer companies; Time
Warner, a leading media and entertainment company; Electronic Arts, the
leading entertainment software publisher; and Silicon Valley venture capital
firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

                             Nintendo Of America
                         To Stay Out of CD-ROM Market

Nintendo of America Inc., opting to stay out of the burgeoning CD-ROM
entertainment market for now, said its next-generation video-game machine
will continue to play cartridges, The Wall Street Journal reported.
  
The 64-bit game system, code named Project Reality, is being developed by
Nintendo and Silicon Graphics Inc. It is set to debut in arcades during the
fourth quarter, followed by a world-wide launch to homes next year. Nintendo
said the home machines would be brought to market for under $250.

Project Reality will replace Nintendo's current mainstay player, a 16-bit
machine called the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo said Project
Reality is so powerful that it will contain five to six times the memory of
the current 16-bit Nintendo games, allowing for superior graphics, sound and
music.

Nintendo officials said they considered using machines based on CD-ROM, as do
their competitors 3DO Co. and Sega of America Inc., but concluded that
cartridge-based games would run faster. The $6 billion-a-year U.S. video-game
industry remains dominated by cartridge-based machines produced primarily by
Nintendo and Sega.

"The cartridge format is the only proven method," Peter Main, vice president
of marketing for Nintendo of America, said in a statement. "CD-ROM, at this
stage of the game, is too slow..." Main added that the cartridge format would
help keep down prices so the new players can sell well in the mass market.

Main indicated Nintendo would continue to evaluate CD-ROM technology, and has
designed Project Reality to accommodate a potential CD-ROM accessory.

                        TARGET SPECIFICATIONS TO DATE

Nintendo has been working with Silicon Graphics Inc. secretly for several
months before the public announcement of a 64-bit home unit.  We've all heard
the basic specifications over and over again from magazines and such, but
we have uncovered the specifications set for "Project Reality" effective since
January 3rd. Keep in mind that they have drastically altered the SNES CD specs
before (and the SNES CD was a no-show). It's possible Virtual Reality's specs
could change as well.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Wow, now these are really impressive specifications. What I
find more interesting than anything else is the new data compression that
this unit will support. 16 meg carts (2 megabytes) can be transformed into
80 to 90 meg carts (10-12 megabytes). That is incredible compression. But as
we all know, Nintendo, Capcom, and other companies are using not only 16 meg
chips, but also 20 megs, 24 megs, and in a few months, even 32 meg chips.
A 32 meg chip (4 megabytes) can be transformed into an *AMAZING* 160 to 182
megs!  That is 20 to 24 megabytes!  And the best part is that we only pay
for the actual size of memory the chip holds when NOT compressed. For
example, 16 meg games cost in the neighborhood of $65 today.  Even though
Project Reality's 16 meg chips can hold up to 6 times the amount of a
normal 16 meg game, we aren't charged any more because we only pay for the
16 meg chip!  So games will easily be in the same price area as they are
today. I can't wait!

Yes Nintendo fans, Project Reality WILL BE a reality!  No and's, if's, but's,
or or's!  We were sent a copy of a statement which shows Nintendo purchasing
2.6 million RISC processors from NEC, and another statement showing Nintendo
purchasing the same amount of RISC processors from Toshiba. Nintendo wouldn't
buy all these high-tech chip for nothing, my friends!  They have something
cooking and in the works!  No bullsh!t!

$39.95          SHOOTER              OVERALL: 5.75
    SUPER NINTENDO

   My GOD does this game suck!  Here is a good game for the young kids, but
   for the teens...BLAH!  It has a beginner's challenge to it, which leaves
   the many avid players sending it back to the store that actually had the
   guts to sell it.  Man, the S.Scope 6 is in trouble (always was),  unless
   someone does something FAST! 

   You have the honor of riding on Yoshi's back, shooting your way through
   a countless number of bad guys and enemies,  like Koopas,  Goombas, and
   boss characters. You cannot control Yoshi's speed or direction, you just
   get to jump every now and then...Well whoop-de-do! Besides that, you just
   pull on that SS6 trigger and blast the enemies. I don't know about most,
   but I beat this game the first time playing it.  The Scope has a turbo
   button for god sakes, anyone could win!

   The graphics weren't much to speak for. There's plenty of Mode 7 keeping
   your moves steady and smooth. And the backgrounds were somewhat colorful
   and they consist of some such as a beach, and an underworld forest.

   The sound...zzzz.  Another bad part of the game.  All you hear is some
   reward music between stages but during the actual game, all you hear is
   your own gun and menacing sound effects.

   This one is not recommended for anyone over the age of 11, or a gamer
   with anything better than a beginner's level. NIntendo made a nasty no-
   no with this one.  Luckily I only rented, and this shows that ever the
   major video game giants can make big mistakes.

        GENESIS

   The first thing you notice when you turn on the power is that you are
   captivated by the sights and sounds that appear on your TV, BUT that's
   all you get to be enchanted about cause the fun sucks.

   You play as the beast and you fight your way through your palace, a snow
   covered forest, and across the rooftops for the final showdown with 
   Gaston.

   The game play is actually fairly straight forward. You move from one end
   of the level to the other, killing all of the enemies you encounter
   along the way. (Really, you do!) The Beast has a nice variety of moves
   you can choose from, such as crouching attacks, or standing.  Easy to
   control with a few tries.

   The graphics truly stand out in front of anything else.  They capture
   the feeling of the Disney classic, for sure. And the backgrounds are
   incredible with lots of details and color.

   The sound is pretty good with nice tunes and well done grunts, groans,
   and growls of the Beast.

   The fun of the game...well, it certainly leaves something to be desired.
   It's the only flaw that's keeping the game from a VERY nice overall
   score.  Great game for the experts in the family.

PACK-IN     SHOOT-EM-UP               OVERALL: 7.25
       JAGUAR

   I started playing this game, and am image came to me.  I saw Star Fox in
   the back of my mind.  Like Star Fox, CyberMorph is a giant polygon flight
   fest with lots of strategy and action.

   CM is a space craft game where you are the pilot and you must collect
   pods filled with scientific equipment scattered all over the galaxy. You
   fly through 5 sectors with 8 planets to get them.

   The polygon graphics are not striking, but beats the crap out of Star Fox
   in a mean way. With Star Fox, you fly in one direction...forward. In CM,
   you fly in ANY direction giving the illusion of a "spacious" environment.
   The smooth, fluid control is an added plus..but hey, they keypad thing
   feels awkward.

   The game play requires a nice amount of strategy, dodging, mountains,
   neutral enemies, and hostile space crafts, Again, very nice, smooth play.

   The game includes a password option after each sector, but even that is
   tough to accomplish because of the difficulty of the game.

   CM's music and sound effects are neither excellent or awful. The cool
   title track will help set the mood the most, but during the actual game
   play all you get are bullets, explosions, and engine roars.

   CM is certainly a challenging game, and if you love strategy shoot-em-up
   style games, you may want to check into CyberMorph for the Atari Jaguar.

       SEGA CD

   Using a 1st person perspective you play as Paul Atreides.  The Emperor
   has sent you and your family to the planet Arrakis (aka Dune) to mine
   spice. With the magical powers of the spice, whoever controls the spice
   can control the world!

   The Harkonnens (evil guys) are also on the planet mining the spice. Your
   job is to fight these men for control of Dune and help the Fremen
   achieve their dream of turning Dune into a flourishing planet.

   The action in this game is very low. With little confrontation you can
   easily collect vital supplies and finish your mission.
   
   The graphics of Dune are something to see. The 3d sequences stand out
   giving great cinematic sequences and hot textured mapping.

   The sound effects and music are very good too, as they are with most
   CD games. The music sound track has a nice variety and mixes with the
   action well. Speech helps bring life to the game, but sounds off beat
   at times with common words.

   At times, you may end up falling asleep during the game while the game
   unfolds.

   All Virgin brought to this game was graphics and sound...the fun is not
   great, but not too bad, either.

$ N/A            ACTION               OVERALL: 8
       SUPER NES

   Claymates is a unique sidescroller from Interplay that is quite easy to
   get used to. Like Clay Fighter, Claymates uses actual claymation. You
   start out as a ball of clay, and as you find other colored balls of
   clay you turn into one of the five animals which include a mouse, cat,
   fish, bird, and a gopher. Each animal has his own weapons and weaknesses.

   The graphics are impressive at times furing the game...certainly
   something to experience for yourself. The game is 5 levels long and they
   are somewhat challenging. The drawback in the graphics are the back-
   grounds. Nothing special about them. They are really basic looking.

   Claymates has fun music and sound effects but I started to go a nuts
   listening to repetitive kiddie music after a while.

   Besides the backgrounds and annoying-at-times music, the game has a
   nice future for it. You can move with reasonable agility, but the jumps
   aren't always on target like you'd hope. Luckily for ya there are un-
   limited continues.

   The game was made with the younger gamers in mind, but Interplay does
   not lack a good challenge. You'll find Claymates fun to play, but don't
   expect any eye opening graphics or new programming tricks. Certainly a
   game to rent. I'm glad I didn't buy it, to be honest.

$ N/A            SPORTS               OVERALL: 8.25
        SEGA CD

   Acclaim is the first company to produce a wrestling game for the Sega
   CD. The game can be very fun if you don't mind waiting for the match to
   start.

   Basically the idea is the same as it is with any other wrestling game;
   kick the crap out of your opponent or BE kicked. The game is very
   similar to the SNES Royal Rumble cart. The Sega CD game gives you a
   selection of 20 wrestlers, all with their unique finishing moves. The
   graphics look basically the same as the cart versions, but the added
   twist is the Full Motion Video clips.

   The sound is something all video game wrestling fans have been waiting
   for. The CD contains the theme music of each included wrestler and the
   bumps and thuds are cool too.

   If you own a previous WWF wrestling game, the controls may seem
   familiar. But if you are new to wrestling games, hope you game some
   extra time to practice cuz you'll need it if you want to win. A six-
   button controller will help.

   If you've played other wrestling games, there is nothing super-
   different or noteworthy to pass on to you because it's basically the
   same as the rest, only improved sound.

   The major drawback in the game for me was the long pauses and frequent
   breaks in the game. Isn't it typical for a Sega CD game? One good thing
   is the option to wrestle ina  steel cage...can you reach the outside
   before your opponent?

   nothing to do with this article and what I may say.

   Pettibone, like I said, you are obviously immature when it comes to
   confrontation. Junk mail like you's sent means nothing, as did any of
   your letters. You ant nothing more than the last word in ANY situation
   and you think you are macho to try and get away with it. Not gonna work
   sweetie.  I don't get mad OR EVEN, I just print it the way I see it. You
   said so yourself to Mike that trying to get under everyone's skin is 
   your goal, it's what you always do.  Well, see, that's where you're only
   fooling yourself because you can send all the junk mail you want, all the
   bad reviews you want and you simply CANNOT even begin to annoy any of us
   because we know that's what you are purposely trying to do.  Nice try,
   but you lose. Contrary to anything you think, Super Effects was a VERY
   respected fanzine, as will Game Guru. 'Nuff said. I wouldn't complain
   how boring you think SE#3 was cause your last fanzine was a real snoozer
   too, to say the least.  And some others I showed the zine to thought the
   same thing.  It's obviously not as great as you think it is.

   I hear you've been trying to call me, honey.  Sorry, but I'm having an
   affair with the milkman. Hope this doesn't hurt our relationship.

   Mike run S.E? Hehe, good one P-bone. It was 50/50 down the middle for
   issue #3. Other than that, I was running it. Chow darling, it was fun.
   Have a splendid life, and get help for that bed wetting problem (Strange 
   how YOU have these kinds of fliers).

   Ha, and as for your claim to me taking info from magazines, yawwwn.
   We've said all along it's all from our computer connections to Nintendo
   IBM, AOL, Prodigy, and others. You are not one to talk about drawings
   from magazines, because your own fanzine is FILLED with them.  That's the
   biggest contradiction I've heard from you, and the longest one I've
   laughed at.  In my book, YOU aren't 'for real' because you are a joke.
   Gee are we sexist, Sean? LOTS of other fanzines print FACTUAL information
   rather than just opinion articles.  What point is there to only TRY to
   annoy me and no one else ever hears from you?  Like I said, the only thing
   you are good for is a laugh. Love the way you tried to annoy me, but
   unfortunate for you, you FAILED.

   All questions unanswered for TUNE-UP have been asked in the interview
   conducted by MIke with out Nintendo Man,  All other mail has been
   answered privately through U.S. Mail. (TONS of letters!)

   (Sigh) Well, I can't think of too much else to say right now that I
   haven't covered in the last issue of Super Effects. I hope you all made
   SOME use out of the Game Genie codes brought to you by Galoob.  Adios
   people (and Sean)!

NINTENDO TAKES A RUN FOR THE BOARDER

Nintendo fo America said it will lay off 136 workers,
close manufacturing operations here and move hardware
and software production for the Latin American markets
to Mexico.

In a press release, the company said Latin American
markets have grown rapidly and the best way to serve
those areas is to transfer manufacturing to Mexico.

The company said it would have made the move even without
NAFTA. The layoffs represent about 9% of Nintendo's 1,500
employees in it's U.S. headquarters.

SEGA TEAMS WITH MICROSOFT

The Wall Street Journal reported that Sega said Microsoft will develop
software for its next-generation game machines, an alliance bringing closer
to reality the much heralded convergence of personal computers and video
game machines.

Microsoft will develop an original operating system for Saturn. Operating
systems control the basic functions of computers, making them easier to use
and to program by providing a layer of user-friendly commands between a
computer's hardware and the user.

Adding an OS to the Saturn may make it easier for game developers to write
software for the machine. it also might give the Saturn a ability to serve
as a so-called set-top box, a piece of hardware that someday may serve as a
control for suchmultimedia functions as interactive television.

The new alliance could pose longer-term risks for Sega. By allowing Micro-
soft to control its operating system, Sega may be opening the door to
erosion of its proprietary game-hardware standard; the main source of its
huge profits.

                              ---QUICK PICKS---
                                 -Matt Lucas

Hi, I'm Matt Lucas. Some of you may remember me from Super Effects. I used
to write game reviews for the fanzine before it got canned. Well, now that
the fanzine is totally different, I'm turning over a new leaf and am going
to write even more! So that means you'll all get a double, maybe even a
triple dose of me, Matt!  Well, this is my new opinion column. Here I will
give you my top five video game picks to do well, and to suck. You don't have
to agree, just read it. So here we go...

                              FUTURE GOOD GAMES


1. MEGA MAN X -(SNES)
   This game will be one of the best games of '94. Mega man is finally brought
to the beautiful world of 16-bit. being that this is Mega Man's first 16-bit 
adventure, it will draw immense curiosity. Video game fans of all ages will
love it. Great graphics, action and all new story line will make this game a
must get, and a best seller!

2. SONIC 3 -(Genesis)
   Another chapter is added to the Sonic saga. In this one, the story is
basically the same as number one and two. But Sonic has a new look in this
installment. The new look makes him much more 3-dimensional and gives him and
Tails more animations. The backgrounds are improved also. This one's a lot more
faster and fun, so like it or not, Sonic's back again in his 3rd adventure,
(aside from Sonic Spinball) and it will do very well.

3. DRAGON'S LAIR -(Sega CD)
   If you loved Dirk's world in the arcades years ago, you're going to love
this one even more! Believe it or not, the new Sega CD version could be even
better than the old laser disc classic! Everything has been translated
exactly. No more long pauses between scenes in this one, Sega has drastically
reduced all the problems you could possibly think of. Good job Sega!

4. WWF RAGE IN THE CAGE -(Sega CD)
   We have another Sega CD game on picks! When you first look at the action on
this game, it looks like an exact replica of WWF Royal Rumble, but it's not
at all!  It has excellent video animation screens and the action is even
faster! it's very realistic too. For instance, you can't bodyslam Yokozuna.
WWf fans aren't the only one's who'll make this one great!

5. SUPER METROID- (SNES)
   Even though very little is known about the future SNES megahit, Mike's
friend Roger at Nintendo has told us a lot! And by the sound of it, this will
literally be the biggest SNES game yet. it's going to be 24 megs. We'll keep
you posted, so stay tuned!


                              FUTURE SUCK GAMES


1. CLAYMATES -(SNES)
   This game is just plain stupid! Stupid story, stupid...everything! The
graphics are good, and that's it. If you thought Clay Fighter sucked...
nevermind. Bad job by Interplay!

2. GOOFY'S HYSTERICAL HISTORY TOUR -(Genesis)
   They got one thing right, it's goofy! I mean, what the Hell is this? He's
a janitor in a museum and he's got to clean stuff.  Wow, fun.  Only stupid
who buy games for the names will want this one.

3. BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA -(Sega CD)
   The movie sucked except for a couple parts, but this whole game bites! The
only good thing about this is the occasional video animation screens, but
that's not enough to excuse the rest of the game. I don't think that Bram
Stoker would've wanted to make this a video game, I didn't.

4. THE INCREDIBLE CRASH DUMMIES -(Genesis)
   Another thing that shouldn't have been made into a video game. Just look
for yourselves! The cinema screens aren't good either.

5. MARIO'S TIME MACHINE -(SNES)
   This game's a major suck-a-thon! If you're older than 8, you'll hate it.
This will do very poorly, for it's very repetitious. If you want to learn
something, get this game.
