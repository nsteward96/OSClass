   c) Fighters parked in carriers, 
   d) Ejected pilots, 
   e) Ground objects,

3) Later presence of Sheffield, Coventry, and Ajax depends upon 
   your success in the earlier missions. If they were destroyed 
   in the early stages of the game, they would be absent in the 
   later actions. 
4) The number of waves of enemy fighters covering the cap ships 
   may depend upon how fast you destroy the mother ships. 
5) Victory's killboard is unstable.
