      This episode of Ace's Angles is in memory of Kurt Cobain.  Sometimes
 life (and death) aren't fair.  Hi gang, it's Ace back again..  and my libido
 is doing just peachy, thank you.  [Smells Like Teen Spirit reference (tm).]
      Okay - what has been going on this week..? Word on the inside is that
 videogame distributors and arcade operators are SICK of Capcom.  3 have goon
 off-the-record with us, and have said that Capcom is releasing too many
 'upgrades' that do almost nothing but cost them money.  They have been burned
 with SSF2 and many aren't interested in SSF2T.  And I don't blame them at
 all.  Sorry Capcom, but until you can count to three my money is going into
 MK2 and NBA Jam Tourney.
      The scoop on Atari: they love GMJ.  How do we know this?  We were
 mentioned in Atari's Roundtable on GEnie [it's like IRC for non- Internet
 users.] Our April Fools joke was mentioned, as was the mag..  and I'd just
 like to thank Bob Brodie (Director of Communications at ATC) and the check is
 in the mail.  [Sarcasm, gang!!]
      Williams has signed on with Nintendo to make the 64-bit Project Reality
 arcade system.  WMS Industries has signed on with Atari for Jaguar products.
 Nintendo says that they gave Atari nothing in the lawsuit Atari won.  Star Fox
 was seen fighting Trevor McFur.  What is this world coming to?
      Deadline? What's a deadline?....  Our special NBA Jam review section
 will be in GMJ 45 as we have had a flood of quality writings that need to be
 shown to the world =] NBA Jam TE is cool, BTW, and you should go and play it
 *NOW*.  It's a nice change of pace..  no decapitations or anything!
      Well, that's it for this week..  come visit us on Tuesday Night IRC
 (see ad located elsewhere in this issue), please! It don't work without your
 help..  :) Cya next Friday.

*** Reader wants more portable coverage

 How about [more?] coverage for portables, especially Sega Game Gear.  It would
 be nice to have a monthly 'Consumer's Guide' type of thing, telling what is a
 good deal and what's not.  For example, say if its worth investing in the
 32-bit processor for the Genesis or just wait for Saturn.  Or projections on
 the Jaguar saying if you think it will prosper or die out and whether its
 worth buying for its present games.  Also which would be the best system to
 invest in (CD?) or to wait for the Sega VR, or whatever.

 [ACE: Hey, Bryant.. nice font in your .sig!  GMJ 46 will have a huge
       "What to bother with" section, and that's a tenative title.  We
       are waiting for our Jag review system and until then, we can't
       really say that system A is better then system B.             ]


*** Singe from the edge

 Anthony,
 Just read GMJ #43.  I realize the whole thing was an April Fool's joke but if
 you're going to do that, don't say "everything in here is a joke!!!" You
 really could have seen how many suckers are out there.  It just seems like a
 waste of time.  Not trying to flame you (well, maybe just a singe...  :-) )
 but, well, just seemed rather pointless to me! Good luck with the next issue.
 Hey, you said you wanted e-mail! Later dude........

*** You guys are pathetic!

 I am writing to you regarding Game Master Journal #43.  I found your "April
 Fool's joke" to be one of the most tasteless, pathetic displays of careless
 journalism I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  I look forward to each
 issue in my mailbox; the only fault I ever find is that it is never long
 enough.  Thank you for an incredulously stupid and stupifyingly hilarious
 April 1.  (Sorry, ran out of adjectives, folks.)

 Why would anyone play Reptile?
 :: Replies to last week's question
****

From alumn132@whscdp.whs.edu  Ukn Apr  1 23:34:18 1994

 That "Why would anybody play Reptile?" gibe hit a nerve with me.  I find Rep a
 very enjoyable char to play.  First of all, there aren't many Reps around, so
 a good Rep is a surprise to see.  (I'm not that good yet, but I'm working on
 it) Reptile is also good at aggravating people (Invisibility + a TAK is very
 annoying) and is good at playing defensive if played correctly.  His acid spit
 is lacking damage wise and Sub-0 can punish Rep for shooting it, but it is a
 good anti-air attack and can be thrown into a combo here and there.

 Reptile's forceball is a powerful weapon, if used correctly.  It is tough to
 learn how + when to use it, but is intimidating and can yield a free uppercut
 if it connects.  "But it can be jumped" you might say, but a good Rep can
 always back up a forceball with that annoying ninja roundhouse.  If you fling
 a FB and your victim sits there blocking like a dope, you throw.  Any way you
 look at it, a FB is almost guaranteed to do damage if released right.

 Invisibility is also annoying if used correctly.  Good Reps know how to keep
 their position hidden for extended periods of time and get a flawless or two.
 Invisibility often sends one's opponent into "panic mode", and they leave
 themselves wide open for a few well-placed attacks.  Invisibility is also
 useful for a cool fatality.  :)

 Reptile may not be the most pow'fo guy, but he is a challenge to learn, and a
 challenge to defeat if that Rep player has sunk plenty of $ into learning him.
 He's also just plain cool, and runs a doll store on the side.  :)

 I could go on for a while yet, but I'd start repeating myself, and I might
 start repeating myself.  :)

 Why would anyone use Raiden?
 :: Replies to last week's question
****
 From: molsen@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu

 I must say that the biggest reason I use Raiden is out of loyalty.  I mean, he
 was sooooo cool in MK I, and now he's been reduced to wearing the
 Wal-Mart/Burger World apron.  But, I enhjoyed playing him in the original,
 and still have fun platying him now.  Sure, he has the weakest throw and all,
 but the in-the-air flying attack is cool.  I do agree he has been weakened to
 a most cheese like degree, but I live close to Wisconsin anyways.
 Thanks......

 OKAY - why would anyone use Kung Lao or Johnny Cage?  PLEASE send your
 replies, and if it's the best one we get, we'll print it!
