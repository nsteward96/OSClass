   Welcome to yet another installment of the Internet's least read
 magazine, Game Master Journal.
   This is our last issue.  Everyone is right - we are the dregs of the
 earth, we shouldn't litter the Net with such dribble..
   NOT!
   This is April 1 gang, it's time for GMJ's annual April Fools issue!'
 But wait, before I do any of that, lets get the legal BS outta da way:

     This issue of GMJ is fiction.  Nothing in it should be taken as
     fact, as it is satire, sarcasm and other things that lawyers love
     to take and make money with.  WE ARE KIDDING FOLKS, nothing here
     has truth.  This changes with GMJ 44, when we return to the
     high ethical, moral and editoral standards that everyone
     associates with Game Master Journal.

   Whew - that was tiring.  Oh!  And another thing.. this is our SECOND
 ANNIVERSARY of being online!  Two fun years of GMJ - and here comes
 number three.. what a way to start!  More 2nd anniversary info in our
 next issue.  NOW THEN - let the fun begin.
   This is our last issue, right, so, um, I won't be seeing you ever
 again!! ARGH!

 Nintendo, Sega call for product boycot

 Los Angeles, (March 32, 1994)
   The Big Two announced today that they are removing all Genesis and
 Super NES products from stores effective immediately.  A Nintendo
 representative said "We cannot in good conscience allow our inferior
 technologies to be sold with Project Reality and Saturn/32X coming so
 soon - only 18 months away."
   She went on to say that anyone selling the product will be fined by
 the FTC for selling antiquated technology.
   Sega's reps echoed Nintendo.  They also said that no more voilent
 games would be allowed on any Sega product.. all games must fit their
 GA rating.
   In a related story, Nintendo signed a deal with Midway, saying that
 MK2 will be exactly like the arcade, blood and all.  MK2 will be out
 this summer, with MK3 hitting the SNES before the arcade, probably in
 time for Christmas.

 TIME WARNER AND ATARI CORPORATION FORM NEW SOFTWARE PUBLISHING FIRM

 Sunnyvale, CA (March 28, 1994)
   Atari Corporation (ASE:ATC) today announces a collaborated software
 firm with Time Warner, Inc.  Avid Software, Incorporated will commence
 operations within the next 30 days and leasing space initially within
 the excutive suites of Atari Corporation in Sunnyvale California.  A
 development lab will be established with the Warner Bros.  Studios in
 Southern California.  The two facilities will be linked by high
 technolgy satellite watts services for real time software development.
 Warner Bros.  will focus on story lines and intense animated graphics.
 The operation in Sunnyvale will assemble the hardware-based and
 software-based graphics engines as well as game play models and
 prototypes.
   The new operation is announced just months following Atari Corp's
 successful launch of a new, high end, 64-bit gaming system dubbed the
 Jaguar.  Avid Software will dedicate 100% of development time for the
 first year exclusively to the Jaguar platform.  Although the core
 development teams have been assembled for the Avid Software project,
 executive decisions will be made by Sam Tramiel, President of Atari
 Corporation, until a permanent executiuve staff has been selected.  A
 panel assembeled by Time Warner will review all long range goals every
 ninety days.
   The first three software titles to be developed by Avid Software and
 scheduled to be released within the fourth quarter of 1994 have also
 been announced.  They promise a unique blend of realistic digitized
 graphics, powerful high-definition animations, unique gaming plots and
 topical story lines.

 Games slated to be produced soon by Avid are:

 HARDING FALLS(tm)--- Just outside of Portland, Oregon a small
 unincorporated town adopts a new name; Harding Falls.  Made popular by
 a local young girl who fought her way to the '94 Winter Games, the
 town unites to launch a new young starlet on to a promising athletic
 career.  Harding Falls is where it all begins.  Local challengers test
 all of their physical savoy against each other for overall performance
 virtues.  Players pre-select their character from an arsenol of
 determined challengers.
   Each stage consists of a practice session in which a complete
 skating routine must be rehearsed.  Obstacles such as untied skates,
 boos from the crowd and irate family members distract your performance.
 With each small win, a weapon toward victory is awarded for use during
 the performance levels.  Sometimes it might be deadly capped teeth.
 Other times it may be a stick or a steel club.
   Play against 64-bits of automated power or one-on-one with an
 aggressive challenger by your side; either way you either win gold or
 cry your way back to Harding Falls to try all over again. Cartridge-
 based game features hidden secrets, multi-player action, high
 resolution graphics and a five dollar coupon toward the purchase of
 "The Club".


 HOLLYWOOD STUNT SPECTACULAR(tm)--- With so many action games designed
 to fight and kill opponents, Warner Bros.  calls upon their army or
 stunt professionals to reveal their best kept secrets to stay alive.
   Take a 125 level backstage studio tour through Warner Bros. hottest
 action films such as Superman, FreeJack, Batman Returns, The Last
 Boyscout and The Fugitive.  Race through high definition scenes of
 your favorite films and pick up props such as breakaway chairs and
 candy glass.  Battle friendly adversaries, but don't hurt them...
 after all, they're really your friends.  Pick up the wrong prop as a
 weapon and you may kill your supporting actor or actress and lose your
 part in the greatest film ever made.
   This fast paced, action game includes the thrills of thrillers and
 the secrets of a great mystery.  The ultimate object is to win without
 hurting anyone, but don't think for a moment there is no blood! One
 player action.  Cartridge-based game includes $5 off coupon for select
 Warner Bros. videos.


 BOBBY BOBBIT AND FRIENDS(tm)--- Here's an animated interactive cartoon
 for adults only! At first glance, it looks harmless enough...  Bobby
 Bobbit is a bouncy bunny that likes to make friends.
   Collect points by finding carrots and hidden treasures.  Unlike most
 treasures, though, Bobby doesn't want to collect coins and tokens.  He
 collects shears, razor blades and carving knives.  Usually Bobby's
 friends help find treasures, but sometimes his friends get too rough
 and Bobby must take corrective action!
   Game includes vivid cartoon violence unlike any other you have ever
 seen.  ONLY on the JagCD, this game is rated NC-17 for violense.
 Let's just say it's a Saturday morning cartoon that will increase
 attendance at Sunday Mass.

 LAST SECOND UPDATE

 We were handed this just as we were aboout to go to spell-check.


 WARNING: Look for clues! You are about to be had! This may be it!

 March 32, 1994 (Clue: This date doesn't exist)
 [commented for the mentally impaired]
 JAGUAR OWNERS EXPOSED TO BOGUS PRESS RELEASE (bogus headline)

 Members dismember each other (overstated) over ethics debate -
 alledged tainted press release blamed (not true, bogus subhead)

 Allover, US-- An unnamed source (unsubstantiated) today reported that
 users of the popular 64-bit Atari Jaguar gaming system have banned
 together (typed online messages) in an effort to discredit the
 infamous "bogus" press release just days before the dreaded April
 Fools holiday is to be celebrated throughout the world (run on
 sentence-hate 'em!).

 Unlike a bug that cripples a computer until the entire system can be
 reboot, the sinister press release causes unusual chemicals to form in
 the brain (lions and tigers and bear a thought, oh my!).  Dr.  Ima
 Knotheir (alias) of the Institute of Preventive Thinking (I.P.T.)
 states that while "some (most everyone) finds some humor as the feared
 press release propagates over the networks, clear laboratory study
 (personal opinion) of those who are without brains indicate there is
 no humor in anything classified as funny." Dr.  Knotheir was unable to
 indicate a direct association of his study to the specific press
 release that launched this one, however.

 In support of the doctor's findings, Jaguar owners have launched an
 attack against any and all bogus press release that contain
 misinformation.  Within six weeks, a committee will be formed to
 establish a panel that will elect a professional staff to advise a
 supervisory board for a new team of advisors to appoint a cabinet to
 determine whether a bogus press release may contain accurate
 information (Government funding is anticipated).  In the interim, all
 bogus press releases must be labeled to contain artificial ingredients
 which have been known to cause brain activity by the I.P.T.  (huh?)

 In their first official action, the Jaguars Owners Bogus Press Release
 Action Committee has classified this bogus press release to be
 impounded and not read.  In compliance with this declaration, the
 following statement has been appended for your safety:

                     IMPORTANT: DO NOT READ THIS!

 Products named are properties of their owning companies.  Text and
 concept (c)1994, Artisan Software.

 Crawfordality, new hidden characters in MK2 version 4.0

 Chicago, IL (March 27, 1994)
   Midway announced today the release of Mortal Kombat II version 4.0,
 and yes, version 4.0 is in the title.  The game will have some very
 minor touch-ups with 4 new characters included.
   "We wanted to be like Capcom," said Ed Boon, programmer/designer of
 MK2.  "After my interview with this bright young man Anthony from GMJ,
 we decided that having many cheap upgrades would be good - just like
 SF2."
   The new version, already in Ottowa and in some middle-of-knowhere
 places in the Midwest, has four new characters, and GMJ has the scoop
 on them!

   Arkady:  "After we saw Tanya [Kutasz, Futuure Wave editor of GMJ] we
             has to put her into the game."  She flies like a vampire,
             prowls like a cat and can cast spells (!!) on her foes.
             She often yells out "Cause Mortal" a la Shao Khan.  You
             get to her by Double Flawlessing 50 opponents and then
             'DF'ing Noob Saibot, only using High Kick.
   Clinton: "Hey, if NBA Jam could do it, why not us?"  He has a deadly
             saxophone, throws Socks and tosses WhiteWater at times.
             [see related WhiteWater article.]  At presstime we don't
             know how to access him - he's cheering the Razorbacks
             right now.
   alt.mk:  "We mentioned the Internet guys in the closing credits, but
             we felt that it wasn't enough."  alt.mk throws fireballs
             like Liu Kang but the damage done varies.. if the player
             counterattacks quickly it does much damage, if he allows
             the flame to pass through him (or under him) it does none.
             Finisher is like Scorpion's Toasty fatality, but instead
             a little guy appears on the screen yelling "Hugo!"
             Some of the Game Masters feel that he says "Yugo!", but
             that's another story.
   Sheng:   "Many SF2 players wonder where he is - well, HERE he is!"
   Long      His only move is to spawn rumors and sequels.  Does damage
             a la alt.mk, except sometimes he can morph into alt.sf2
             Very dangerous character.

   In a related story, a new fatality can be done with the Ninja
 Girls.  If you defeat a character using only punch you can morph into
 Cindy Crawford.. a Crawfordality.  She climbs atop your foe's
 shoulders and goes to do a Cammy Frankenstiener, but she slips.. going
 into a position we prefer not to mention in GMJ.  The Pepsi and MTV
 people are pleased.

 Well, it's out! It's the Doom you've been waiting for - Episode 4 hits
 the stores today.  And what a sequel! It's all that we could wish for
 and more.

 It seems that our loyal space marines are transported this time to
 another dimension altogether, after escaping from Hell in the previous
 episodes.  The setting this time: Heaven.  The Elysian Fields couldn't
 be more beautiful than the graphics portrayed here - Meadows with
 warm, fuzzy bunny rabbits and colorful butterflies fill the game,
 along with sun-dappled forests that are home to Bambi-like deer and
 friendly racoons.  Your Mission: make sure there's enough food for all
 Heaven's inhabitants.  Can't have those cute little cotton tails
 turning belly up because their bellies are empty, now can we?

 The way in which you do this is by searching out the food supplies and
 opening them up to the animals by pressing the space bar, much the
 same as opening up doors in the last episodes.  And guess what? You're
 linked with the animals by a psionic connection - and every time one
 of them dies from starvation, you lose health points.  So keep your
 eyes open for berry-filled bushes that are out of the reach of furry
 little paws.  And make sure you get all the thorns off, too - can't
 have bloody tracks all over the forest.  Might attract big bad nasties
 that'd eat the bunnies and leave their heads on spikes in random
 spots, with blood dripping down the sides.  Oh, but wait - this is
 Heaven, after all.  No bad creatures here.  Everything's friendly.  So
 you don't have to worry about being attacked from behind while you're
 fulfilling your Mission.  Want to play with friends? No problem! The
 unsavory Deathmatch option has thankfully been eliminated, leaving you
 with the more interesting of the two choices - cooperative mode.  So
 you all get to help save the animals.  What fun!

 The graphics, as stated earlier, are far superior to the last DOOM put
 out by id games.  Soft pastels are abundant, the animals look
 true-to-life, and when you get that food to feed them, you actually
 see your hand reach out and place it at their fuzzy little feet.  How
 quaint! How exciting! How could we ever have loved the death and
 destruction of Inferno? This episode far outreaches its predecessor in
 all ways, and will be a pleasure to play.  It should also soothe the
 nerves of all those activists who think that the past episodes were
 too violent - none of that unwelcomeness here, simply good, clean,
 pure fun.  Who wants to see cyber-demons destroyed by BFG's anyhow?
 Not I! I give this a definite four stars, without question.  Play it,

 wonderous creatures.  Meanwhile, enjoy!

 Ace - 100
 Happy Happy, Joy Joy!  I love you, you love me..
