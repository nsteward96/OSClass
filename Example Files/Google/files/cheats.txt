Batman The Movie (Ocean): while the intro screen is displayed, hold down

lives and the cheat mode is off every time you enter a new level.

player 1 go to the shop, 5 makes player 2 go shopping, DELETE makes everybody
go to the next level provided you got the dough.

-*- Bloodwych (Imageworks): go through the normal buying process but when it
comes to actually paying the creature, don't put money in the transfer slot.
Drop in any other item instead. The creature will tell you it's a pathetic
price but will give you what you want anyway.

(X) Bombuzal (Imageworks): when reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to
sacrifice a life to see the explosion pattern.
When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's easier to see its
size.
You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting, so use it to your
advantage!

(X) Bubble Bobble (Firebird/Taito): hold down the fire button after losing your
last life, and you should get another set of lives, though your score will be
reset. More hints:
While in the first screen, bubble the first two monsters and then fill the
screen with hundreds of bubbles.  Bubble and burst the remaining monster and
the remaining bubbles should turn into fruit (usually bananas), each of which
is worth 500 points.
Beating level 100: jump on the small platforms to collect all the green potion
bottles. they will give you lightning bolts. Jump down alongside the wall and
let that monster have it!! After 100 hits, he will turn into a bubble. Pop him
and you've done it!

-*- Builderland (Loriciel): level access codes:
Level 1 BUILD1, 2 YOTTHA, 3 BEARBY, 4 OCTOPY, 5 DIABLO, 6 GOTIUS.

-*- Cabal (Ocean): type SCHLIKA during the game and wait for the border to
flash. Pressing F2 advances you one level forward.

Captain Blood (Infogrames): during hyperspace, hold down the left mouse button,
and right-click repeatedly. This will shorten the hyperspace sequence.
And now, the complete walk-thru:
Go see Buggol (Planet Mind 137). Land and tell him "me want vote". He will tell
you of another Buggol called morlok who lives on planet Rosko 1. Keep talking
until you get the coordinates. Go see Morlok. Say to him:" me not vote Morlok,
me want Yukas president". He will give you the coordinates of a planet called
Female 021. Go and destroy it. Come back to Rosko 1. He will now give you the
coordinates of a planet where an Ondoyante is kept prisoner (you didn't need to
go there, though...). Go to exterior view and destroy Rosko 1. Go back to Mind
137, and go see the Buggol. He now dislikes you intensely, and will give you
the coordinates of Rosko 2. Go there, and teleport the Buggol into your ship.
Find an uninhabited planet, and teleport him there. He will say the planet is
good-looking and, if you ask "me want know coordinates planet number = Blood",
he will give you the coordinates to find number 2.
Go there, land, and say you like him, and will not kill him. You must also get
three sets of coordinates from him before disintegrating him (having made sure
you saved the game beforehand). Now go around using this method to get the
coordinates out of the numbers, always killing them before you move on.
Kill the last one, and you win!
That was the walk-thru. Now here's a trick: at the start of the game you will
automatically be in orbit around an alien planet.  Transport down and try to
find an alien, preferably Yuko, if it isn't Yuko, it may be best to restart the
game as he is the key to the game. Talk to Yuko about his father, Maxon, and
you will find he is in prison. He will also give you the coordinates for
Croolis Ulv, where you will find another alien. While you are talking to Yuko,
he will give you the code 1010; this always remains the same. Go to Croolis Ulv
and you will be given the co-ordinates for Croolis Var. Go there and destroy 
it, then go back to Croolis-Ulv. The alien will now be nice to you, keep
talking to him and you will get the coordinates for the Forbidden planet.
Go to the Forbidden planet (Sinox), and you will meet a guardian robot.  Give
him the code you received from Yuko.  Now watch what happens.

(X) Carrier Command (Rainbird): While in the Walrus arming menu, select nine
Harbinger surface to surface missiles and put them in the AAV.  Select the
Avatar Chemical Laser and place it over the missiles. Then select the pod you
want (ACCB, Virus Bomb, Fuel) and place it in the AAV.  Then, when you've
launched the AAV, look at it's weapons and you'll find you have BOTH missiles
and laser!  On returning to the carrier any missiles you have left will be
added to the ship's stores.  Carry on doing this and hundreds of missiles can
be yours.
Another cheat: while in the pause mode, type "GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME"
(include the spaces). You should now see the message "Cheat mode active".
Pressing the + key on the numeric keypad protects your Mantas and AAVS
from missile attacks. The - key can be used to turn this off.
Pressing the following keys in sequence: 'Help', Q, S, Control, Alternate,
gives you a little message. Pressing the 9 on the keypad displays the current
level. 8 displays the frame rate, 6 displays the palette.
Returning to the title screen, press the + and - keys to view all objects in
the game.

Car-Vup (Core): get a high score and enter one of these:
PUSSYCAT gives you 9 lives, BUMPER gives you temporary invulnerability,
WHOOPSIE (or WHOOPS) takes you to the last level (prehistoric).

Chariots Of Wrath (Impressions): hit "." on the keyboard repeatedly, and
you'll get infinite lives. While you're in the spaceship mode, hit the function
keys to get weapons. When you have a weapon, press * or 8 (both on the keypad)
to power it up.
Or, move the joystick forward when you're instructed to press Fire to start.
You get infinite lives.

Chase HQ (Ocean): as soon as the title screen has disappeared, hit the space
bar several times at high speed until the game is through loading and the
game starts. You should now be able to drive at 1,000 kmh, among other things.
Or, hold down the fire button and left mouse button simultaneously, and type
GROWLER to activate the cheat mode. Now, whenever you press "T", it resets
the clock to 60 seconds...

Damocles (Novagen): here's the quickie solution:
Do all the preliminary stuff (land, get key, drive to office, etc...), get the
spaceship. Fly to 12:14 and get the computer. Fly to 15:03 and buy the
pressure suit. Fly to Snow Island, land at 03:00 and get the cupboard (there's
a Nova trigger in it). Fly to Bare Island, land at 06:02, and go in the
transporter on the ground floor. Keep going in the transporter until you wind
up at 07:01, UR City on Gaea. Find the cupboard (Nova trigger inside) and go
back the way you came.
Fly to Metis and land at 05:06, then get the sink (or washbasin). To get it,
walk to the table that's facing you when you come in. The wall behind the
table will move (secret passageway!). Go in the secret room and get the sink
(another Nova trigger).
Fly to Gaea, go to Chaldea Metropolis, and land at 06:06. Get the gold in the
basement. Fly to 05:08 and sell the gold. Fly to 05:06 and get the stereo
system (Nova trigger inside). Fly to 09:02 on UR and get the Nova Bomb, in
the basement, behind the elevator.
Fly to Damocles and land on it (I didn't know you could do that!!). Leave the
Nova bomb on the comet and retreat to a safe distance. Switch on the Nova
triggers one by one. Kaboom!© You win!!
Paul Woakes (the designer) says that there are many different ways to solve
his game. The method described above is the fastest.

Darkside (Spotlight): hold down 2, 8 and Fire for digitized pics of the
programmers.

Day Of The Viper (Accolade): this is not a hint, this is a warning.
Every time you leave a floor or a building (via a turbolift or a shuttle),
the program saves 2 files containing level data, one called LEVELXX.DAT, and
one called LEVELXX.BAK. The XX stands for the level number: 01 for floor 1 in
building 1, 06 for floor 1 in building 2, etc... (5 floors and 5 buildings for
a total of 25 floors). So, for every level you leave, 2 files gets saved.
If you have dumped the contents of disk 1 and 2 on a standard double-sided
disk, you will run out of room and your game will crash nastily, destroying
all your saves files.
The possible solutions:
1) Format an extended double-sided disk (80 tracks with 10 sectors is fine).
2) From the desktop, erase the save files for the levels you won't be returning
to (too time-consuming and silly), or...
3) Stick it on your hard drive and sleep well at night.
(Thanks go to The Insane 0ne from the Jungle BBS for spotting this bug.)

Death Trap (Anco): get a high score and enter GIRLS. When next you play,
you can replenish your potion pots with F6, F7, and F8.

you to the next level and I toggles invincibility on and off.
Type GOATY to become invincible. Here's some level codes:
LEMAC, ZIPPO, LAZER, DAFAD, MAMOG, FUNKY, and DONKY.

(X) Dogs Of War (Elite): type TIMBO while playing then press F5. This switches
off the sprite detection routine, but when you reach the end of a level, you
won't be able to touch the object of your quest!! You're stuck!

-*- Dominator (System 3): type SHAFT on the high score list for infinite lives.
Or, type ZAE of NeXT to access a hidden game.

Double Dragon (Melbourne House/Arcadia): when the title screen pops up,
type in the followings:
LEVEL ONE PLEASE (start on level one), LEVEL TWO PLEASE (start on level two),
and so on until level four, THE LAST LEVEL PLEASE drops you on the last level,
GIVE ME MORE HEALTH PLEASE (lots of energy!), I DO NOT WANT TO DIE
(invincibility!). Just remember to say please!!!

hit Esc like crazy until the credits go bonkers and you get infinite lives.

and 2. You will be transported to Technocity. Do it again, and you will be
sent to Iceland.

Dragon's Lair (Readysoft): on the title screen, press 0 to begin play,
then hit RETURN and enter GODIRKGO. The cheat mode should now be on.

Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp (Readysoft): tired of playing the game?
No problem!! Start the game and as soon as Dirk pops up, type MORDROC.

in French; F10 to pause.

Move the joystick diagonal up/left, press fire, then press E. You now enter
the game editor. Pressing ESC returns you to the level selector mode
(pressing SPACE from the level selection mode returns you to the game).
That was the unofficial way to enter the game editor; here's the official way:
you need two drives or a hard disk. Boot your computer, then put the Fusion
disk in drive A and a blank disk in drive B (or C). Diskcopy A to B.
Go to the B directory and rename QAZ.MON into FUSION.TOS. Double-click on
FUSION.TOS to run it (you need to have Fusion in drive A to run it, otherwise
FUSION.TOS won't run. Any modification you make to the levels will be saved
to drive B). Type SWAMP THING into the high-score list, then press E.
+ loads next level, - loads previous level, joystick up/left while pressing
fire and E dumps you to the level editor. Joystick up/left while pressing
fire and S saves the level you're currently editing.
Level editor keys: use the function and number keys to select the appropriate
tile from the menu at the top; use the cursor keys to adjust the position of
the tile; use Tab to put it down; use Undo if you change your mind; press A
and use the cursor keys to adjust the tile's height, press Enter when done;
press P to cycle through the color palette with the keypad 1/4, 2/5 and 3/6;
+ and - on the keypad are used for changing the color of the parallax level;
press Enter when you're done adjusting the colors; pressing X lets you edit
the exit data, + and - to select the exit, press S to set the position,
use + and - to select which level the exit leads to, then the cursor keys to
set the position of the entrance to that level; press W to modify the weapon
data, + and - to flick through the weaponry, S to select the one you want,
use + and - again to set the part number, 1 thru 9 are bomb parts, 10 are the
fat bullets, 11 are the triple shots, 12 are the shields, and 13 is extra fuel;
be careful not to exceed those weapon numbers; you can use the keypad to edit
the level, 1-2-3-4-6-7-8-9 are joystick equivalents, 0 to paste, "." to cut,
+ and - to choose the tile under the pointer; use the cursor keys to display
the six switches at the top of the screen; to test a switch, press 0 thru 5
and the screen will zoom in on that switch and test it; press Undo to change
it, then another number if you want, press S to set a switch.
You can actually create a game with 40 levels!! To create a new level, go to
the Level Select Mode and hit + beyond the last level. When creating
additional levels, you must make sure that the last line of blocks at the top
and bottom of the screen are raised blocks, otherwise the game will crash
when you pass the boundary.

collect it. You'll hear a gong. You should now have 50,000 health points and
32,000 reflective super-shots. The shots will vanish once you leave the level,
and if you pick up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots.
Here's a handy general tip: if you run out of keys and there's still some doors
to open, don't hang around waiting for the doors to open. You're wasting
valuable hit points! Pause the game and go do something else for 2 minutes.
Come back and resume the game, and all the doors will open.

Only steal if you actually hit the ball,
Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves towards the end,
Bunting rarely works,
Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for Harris,
The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others will only be
successful for a short while,
Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result in home runs,
Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired, their
accuracy and speed get worse.

Hard Drivin' (Domark/Tengen): here's something silly to try:
start a game, turn around and drive in the opposite direction! Go to one of
the checkpoints, cross it, then turn around again and go back to the finish
line. And voila! A new track record...
In a more serious vein: drive up the first hill on the speed track. Pass the
fork in the road. When you're in the air, shift to neutral. You should be able
to race around the track without skidding...

players gain an extra life by picking up the tokens. That player will now last
longer, so when the other player dies, the one with the extra life will play a
level on his own. Complete this level, and on the next, both players will
receive 99 extra lives.

Heroes Of The Lance (SSI), just some general tips:
arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong warriors,
Raistlin and Goldmoon. This allows you to use Raistlin's magic and the healing
staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle. Save Tanis and Riverwind for the
later levels, where the bows come in handy.
When fighting Gully Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.
His sling stones will never miss.
Avoid fighting Hatchlings, they're not worth it. Just turn and run when you
meet one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path and wait a
little. When you return, the Hatchling will have gone.
Killing Bozaks: two methods: 1) get Raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell
to stun it, then send a warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select Flint,
who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will go over his head;
get close to enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it.
Spectral Minions: they're easy to kill, so use a warrior.
Wraiths: a well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time. If you miss,
use a sword and chest-thrust movements. Don't let it get too close to you!
Spiders: use low thrusts to keep them at bay. If they get through your guard,
retreat until you can turn and fight again.
The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters, and yellow
give your characters extra confidence.

Earthling boxes. The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from

Clutter Of Noodles ...huh, Cluster of Nodules - on beautiful downtown Dante.

it in for a flat diamond.
Lump Of Mineral Rock - Q-Beta surface.
Crate Of Castrobars - go to Enos and grab a tree, trade it in at the Castron
depot ("Look everybody! Toothpicks!!!").
Professor Taymar - After getting all of the above ingredients, go to Broadway.
Make sure you have a crate of Castrobars in the hold. Cruise the surface and

(X) Starray (Logotron/Spinnaker): here are a few playing tips:
Concentrate on the landers. When you shoot 'em, some release bonus capsules,
so spraying everything in sight isn't good policy. If the lander releases
a capsule with an X on it, don't pick it up; these capsules drain part of your
shield energy. The capsule marked P gives you penetrating lasers; these aren't
so hot either, since they go right through everything and wipe out bases and
bonus capsules. When shooting rectangular ships (airbuses), approach them from
the right side since the bonus capsules always eject on the right.
Also, turning off the sound should speed up the game, supposedly...

Stormtrooper (Creation): play the game and get a high-score. Enter

at the same time.
3) When each treasure is picked up, your heart rate goes back to normal.
4) Always use the F key to look forward when you get disoriented.
5) Use the Ankhs only as a last resort, since they're more useful later on.
6) In Illusion, use the sector names to map it out.

Total Recall (Ocean): type LISTEN TO THE WHALES when the title pic appears.
You can now absorb enemy blows without harm, but don't worry if the energy bar
still shrinks. When you get to the taxi driving section, type JIMMY HENDRIX.
Your JohnnyCab is now indestructible!
If you're the type who has time to kill (haha!), leave the game on pause for
one whole hour. When you come back to check up on your computer, the words
"Cheat mode active" should appear on the screen. Start playing again and
discover that you now have infinite ammo!

Tower Toppler (Epyx): see Nebulus (Hewson)...

Toyota Celica GT Rally (Gremlin): simply press C to finish the stage and
go on to the next one. When you press C, your name will be put on the
scoreboard at whichever time you pressed C: if you hit it at 1:51, the
scoreboard will indicate that your finishing time was 1:51.

Trailblazer (Mindscape/Hewson): hold down Help, I, 1 and 2, then type
CHEAT. Now, F3 will remove gravity, F5 will change ball shape, F6 will change
the other player's ball, and Help will produce a laugh.

-*- Treasure Island Dizzy (Codemasters): when the game starts, type ICANFLY.
And now you can! Or type EGGSONLEGS to become invincible!

Turbo Outrun (US Gold): type WEARAPEEPEL while the countdown is running,
and you get some nifty options:
pressing T will give you extra time, B will restart the stage, N will send
you to the next level, G uses up a credit (huh?), and D will give a new set
of turbo boosters.
Also, pressing 1 thru 9 will send you to the appropriate level.
And finally, pressing F will complete the entire game!!!

(X) Turrican (Innerprise/Rainbow Arts): get a high score and enter ANTIDOTE.
This gives you infinite lives, and as the saying goes, "You'll need 'em!".

-*- Turrican II (Rainbow Arts): when you get to the end of level 3 and
confront the guardian, turn into a gyroscope and stay on the guardian's
head. Nothing will seem to happen, except that your life counter will start
to increase but one unit at a time. You can do this until you get 99 lives!

The Untouchables (Ocean): on level 1, pause the game and type BRIDGE ROLLS.
This will send you to level 2. To get to level 3, pause and type MAC NALLEY.
To get to level 4, pause and type KID ZAPPING. To get to level 5, pause and
type A NIT IN TIME.

(X) Venus: The Flytrap (Gremlin): level access codes in ascending order:
MANTIDS, CICADAS, PSYLLIDS, PIERIDS, SATYRID, LYCAENID, PYRALID, and NOCTUID.
Cheat codes:
JUPITER stops time, and PLUTO gives you unlimited ammo for any extra weapon
you pick up.
SUN, FREEPLAY, AJAR and LISTEN all do something, but I don't know what...

-*- Verminator (Rainbird): go to the shop and buy a hammer. Then sell it for
50 credits. Go up to the till (what's a till?) and you'll have bought the
falcons for 50 credits. Sell these to make some serious dough.

Veteran (Software Horizons): press Help to go to the next level!

Vigilante (US Gold): get a high score and enter POOKY IS MY PAL.
While playing, F1 increases your lives, F8 takes you to the next level.
Or type GREEN CRYSTAL in the high-score list.

(X) Virus (Firebird): hold down Enter on the keypad, and press P to pause.
Continue holding Enter down and press O to unpause. Everything will look
normal except for an extra bar below the altitude gauge. Pressing the
following keys as the described effects:
C - special F/Xs on/off,
D - demo on/off,
F - refuels you completely,
L - adds one missile every time it's pressed,
N - turns cheat off.

Viz (Virgin Games): Anyway, type WHAT A LARGE SET OF BOLLOCKS on the character
selection screen (or WITH A LARGE SET OF BOLLOCKS). You should hear a weird
noise, and pressing 1 through 5 on the keyboard will send you to the appropriate
 level.

(X) Voyager (Ocean): in the options screen, type in WHEN THE SWEET SHOWERS OF
APRIL FALL. You will be dumped in an editor screen where you can choose
from a number of cheat options. Press Delete during play to reduce the number
of enemies to destroy by ten.

(X) Warhead (Activision/MPH): as a veteran FOE-57 pilot, let me pass on a few
useful hints and tips for successfully completing the missions.
1) Docking:
Define one of the navig markers as a target, then get as close to it as you
can, using autopilot mode 4. Rotate until you're facing Solbase. Switch to
tactical display mode 1 and center Solbase in the crosshairs. If the center
of Solbase is completely white (and I mean completely!!), you are correctly
aligned. If you are too far to see, use the zoom feature. Fly toward Solbase,
making sure the center stays white, and you'll dock perfectly every time!
2) Your weapons and how to use them effectively:
Data-gathering missiles: not a weapon. Use those to get info on any "unknown"
you come across, including enemy missiles.
Mass-driver cannon: use to destroy incoming missiles, especially those big
blue and white ones the Berzerker fires!! They're Pseudo-Stellar missiles,
and they'll kill you on contact, guaranteed or your money back!!!
Stinger missiles: they only have an effective range of about 2,500 meters.
Mines: not terribly useful. Try to lob them in the path of incoming ships.
X-ray Laser mines: wowee!! These are neato!! If you have 3 or more ships
pestering you, launch a mine at them. Usually the mine will take out all three.
Pseudo-Stellar missiles: you only get these toward the end of the game. They
are nasty and you should be at least 4,000 meters away from your target when
they go off!
3) Enemy ships and the best way to destroy them:
Drone: a single round from your MD cannon will pulverize this joker!
Drone Squadron: a couple of Stingers will do it.
A-Wing: Stingers, a couple.
C-Wing: Stingers, at least 3.
H-wing: X-ray Laser mines, or lots of Stingers.
Berzerker: don't even think of destroying this guy! Just blow up his Pseudo-
Stellar missiles with your MDC, that will annoy him for sure...
3) general stuff:
Follow orders at all time. When Quad-jumping, always go straight to wherever
you're supposed to go. Don't waste time. I got screwed up a couple of times
when I came back to Solbase because I jumped to Solar orbit, then jumped to
Solbase. I was coming back from another star system. You should select SOL G2V
first then select Solbase (on the in-system map), then jump!
Have fun out there!

Warhawk (Firebird): after loading, press F3. When you start the game, a blue
blob appears on the screen. Pick it up and you get infinite power.

Weird Dreams (Rainbird): start a game, walk into the right-hand mirror,
go as far as you can before finally disappearing and use the Help key to enter
the equivalent of SOS in morse code (3 quick taps, 3 long taps, then 3 quick
taps). You get infinite lives.

-*- (X) Wings Of Death (Thalion): enter ST FOREVER on the menu screen and the
screen should flicker red a few times. Pressing the following keys:
F1 changes to insect, F2 changes to bat, F3 changes to eagle, F4 changes to
dragon, F5 changes to griffin, F6 calls up a hunter, F7 calls up a destroyer,
F8 truns on the shield, F9 turns on autofire, F10 restores energy.
Keys 1 through 5 on the main keyboard adjust weapon strength.

X-Out (Rainbow Arts): to get lotsa cash, select the smallest ship (the
one at the top). Then,  select the weakest laser (orange with single beam)
and place it over the shopkeeper's nose (so to speak). Hit the fire button,
and watch your bank balance grow...
If that don't work, try this:
buy the biggest ship, then pick up a stationary satellite and click it on
your money total (score). Give it to Moleb, and your money total will rise
to 500,000.
Also, you can buy the shield then throw it away. You get 500 credits for that.
Repeat as needed, or until you get bored.

Xybots (Tengen): get a high score and enter ALF. You get infinite lives.

(X) Zany Golf (Electronic Arts): there is a hidden course on level 9 (Energy).
To the left of the screen, you will see a mouse hole with two glowing eyes.
When the eyes glow red, putt the ball in the hole. A new level will load.
It's called Mystery...

Zombie (UBI Soft): if you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good
idea on how to solve most of the puzzles. But here's some extra tips anyway:
1) To lock up the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park the
trucks over the entrances. Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor and
go to the 4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.
2) To keep the dead zombies from coming back to un-life, lock them up in the
freezer in the basement.
3) before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light. Get
the fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!

-*- Z-Out (Rainbow Arts): during play, hold down J and press 1 through 6 to
skip levels, and 1 through 3 on the keypad to go to different stages.
